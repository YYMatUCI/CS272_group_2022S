They wanted to assuage people that phase 3 trials are meant to catch any kind of side effects such as this as well as proving that the vaccine works. So take a look at what Johnson Johnson is saying in the statement, they say that serious Adverse Events are not uncommon in clinical trials.

They're not saying at this point whether this volunteer in the trial had their vaccine or if they had a placebo so they don't know that but as yet hitting pause for now and it's unclear how long that will be for but Johnson & Johnson says, this is all going to be looked at by an independent review board.

That's right AstraZeneca. We were telling you about this last month that trial also known as the Oxford University trial.

This is basically standard process for a clinical trial if someone gets sick for any reason whatsoever vaccine or non vaccine-related, they're going to push pause and they're going to investigate to make sure that it truly isn't vaccine-related. We'll hear more about what this is in the hopefully in the days to come and we'll have a better understanding of whether or not it's related to the vaccine or not.
