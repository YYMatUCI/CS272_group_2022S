Allen and a hundred sixty four people were surveyed and asked what their symptoms were when they had covid-19 and get this 96 percent of them said they had one of the following number one a fever cough or shortness of breath and 45 percent of them said they had all three of these symptoms.

For example amputations can happen due to lack of oxygen lack of blood flow and problems with blood pressure.
