They are more likely to express these receptors and higher numbers and that is somewhat allowed us to predict the type of symptoms people will have and sure enough we've seen through experience. They are having these additional symptoms.", "Classic ones you'll hear about are fevers and any kind of respiratory symptoms like shortness of breath or cough or anything that involves the lungs, but we also know that people are likely to express these receptors in the mouth and the throat and in the GI tract so we have seen people get sore throat some kinds of GI upset diarrhea. Sometimes we also know these receptors are expressed on the heart and sometimes people get inflammation.", " None of the heart tissue itself and some chest pains. So we've even had some people present with what they thought was a heart attack. And in fact, it was inflammation of some of the heart tissue that caused by the virus itself. We also know that people can have some effect in the nerves around the face that can cause an alteration and smell or an alteration in taste and some people have noticed some skin changes, although that is been a little less specific the vast majority.", " Atia people will still have fever and some sort of respiratory symptom and frequently achiness like you have any kind of viral syndrome, but over time we are seeing some of these additional symptoms the other one that has been far less often, but could be predicted from again where we see this receptor being expressed is inflammation of the testes orchitis, and we have seen some symptoms of that over time as well."], "confidence": [0.8751822710037231, 0.721477746963501, 0.8165959119796753, 0.8638616800308228]}}, "text_detection": {"text": ["STACEY RIZZA, M.D.", "CLINIC", "CUNIC", "Mayo Clinic", "MAYO", "INFECTIOUS DISEASES"], "text_segment": {"timeoffset": [["start_time: 3.6036, end_time: 8.4084"], ["start_time: 0.0, end_time: 30.4304", "start_time: 31.031, end_time: 87.3873", "start_time: 88.088, end_time: 113.3132", "start_time: 114.2141, end_time: 116.9168"], ["start_time: 64.66460000000001, end_time: 64.7647"], ["start_time: 3.6036, end_time: 8.4084"], ["start_time: 0.0, end_time: 30.4304", "start_time: 31.031, end_time: 87.3873", "start_time: 88.088, end_time: 113.3132", "start_time: 114.2141, end_time: 116.9168"], ["start_time: 3.6036, end_time: 8.4084"]], "confidence": [[1.0], [0.9597197771072388, 0.9545043110847473, 0.9614800810813904, 0.9533188939094543], [0.7338760495185852], [1.0], [0.9668781161308289, 0.9685962796211243, 0.9677056074142456, 0.9675485491752625], [1.0]]}}}
