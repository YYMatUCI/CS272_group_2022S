officials here in the US moving fast to prepare for what the CDC has called an inevitable spread. We are right now in a very active containment mode thousands of Americans Nationwide already under voluntary self quarantine after returning from China, even though they don't pose any immediate risk, the US has faced outbreaks before from SARS in 2003, which killed at least", " 874 globally to the H1N1 virus in 2009 which had an estimated Global death toll of at least 150 1000 both outbreaks providing the government a roadmap as it navigates the days and months ahead at Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago. Dr. Benjamin singer says they're on alert for Coronavirus even as the ER and ICU are filled with patients recovering from the seasonal flu. How do you distinguish between coronavirus and the typical flu?", " Can be a challenge when a patient first presents for care because the symptoms overlap quite a bit. That's why we pay a lot attention to their history where they've travelled and the people with whom they've been in contact. Meanwhile US Health screenings continue at select US airports. The CDC is Distributing new test kits to Public Health Labs Nationwide as early as next week ensuring there are enough supplies on hand including surgical masks and gowns First Responders now training to identify possible cases.", " In Pittsburgh, they've been given personal protection kits Health experts though insist and outbreak will look nothing. Like what's been depicted in Hollywood movies when we run out of body bags like contagion in 2011. It will look and feel to the American people more like a severe flu season in terms of the interventions and approaches. You see President Trump says he'll do whatever is necessary. Even if that means following China's lead and quarantine entire cities. We do have plans at all.", " Just gave we need it. We don't think we're going to need it. But you know, you always have to be prepared prepared to take every precaution while facing a new and unfamiliar disease and Tom even on the way down here flying down here a couple of people had those face masks masks on so it got me wondering a lot of folks wondering are they a good idea that they do they do anything? Yeah. So I asked dr. Singer here at Northwestern that very question and and he referred me to the CDC guidance which has if you are sick or if", " Somebody in your family is sick. Then this makes a good idea. Right because you wanted to avoid spreading the germs it's less effective. If you're simply trying to avoid getting sick by going through an airport or a bus station or whatever else. This may not be that helpful. What is helpful is to constantly wash your hands don't touch your face. And if you're in a clinical environment take advantage of the hand sanitizer, you know, all of us here in the ER have been doing this constantly both yesterday and today.", " You mention the CDC Tom. There's news this morning that they're they're changing their criteria for testing patients. After that first case of Unknown Origin in the US was confirmed. What more can you tell us about that? Yeah, and this is critical right because up until now they were separating these cases out by simply by the travel history. But now if this disease is spreading on its own in the United States that no longer is enough. So they're now going to be pushing 93 test kits to Labs across", " cross the country by this weekend so that there will be a quicker way to diagnose somebody with coronavirus. Meanwhile 70 companies are competing with finding a some sort of a diagnostic test for hospitals to use at the bedside so that you don't have to necessarily send those out to a lab. But absolutely the whole Spectrum here is opening up if this is now Out Among the population as opposed to a simple travel history alone.", ""], "confidence": [0.859187662601471, 0.8274824619293213, 0.8568451404571533, 0.7687219381332397, 0.793450653553009, 0.8580802083015442, 0.7587553858757019, 0.8775655627250671, 0.0]}}, "text_detection": {"text": ["M", "coRTROL ARD PRRV", "CPUS", "ELUARANTINE", "MERGENCY", "\u5fc3\u7cfb \u6c49", "Medicine", "SOLD", "Cev", "TOM COSTELLO", "Cave", "L", "denjamin singer MD", "87", "CENTRRSFOR DISEASE", "SECRETARY OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES", "CAMPUS", "CoVE", "YAGE", "Part", "HOUS", "criticarca", "D", "TOOAY", "FTUARANTINE", "AL HOSPITAL IN CHICAGO", "CENTRRS POR DIREAE", "SELEHUARANTINE", "nCc", "B-", "denjamin Singer MD", "CENTERS rOR DISEASE", "HP", "(", "SANDWICH-S", "ayRAMEX", "SANDWICHss", "CORTROL AND PRRVN", "9211", "EDWARD RRO", "OUS", "-LIVE", "AND GOWNS", "0000", "CONTROL AND PREVER", "EDWARD RARoy", "CONTROL AND PREVENTie", "SELFDOARANTINE", "SAN WICHES", "critical co", "HOSPITAL IN CHICAGO", "SELFDUARANTINE", "WARNER BROS.
