Dr. Inglesby is the director of the Center for Health security at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. Good morning doctor. Thanks for being with us. How concerned Anthony How concerned are you about coronavirus transmission at polling stations and should people feel safe voting in person.", " I think if people follow simple simple instructions take normal kind of sensible actions that the risk can be as little as going to the pharmacy or going to the grocery store, but they have to think about it ahead of time plan ahead of time and then act in ways that public health suggests when they're at the at the voting voting place. What about those polling stations wear masks are not required.", " Yeah, well in every place in the country people should be using masks when they vote. I think I mean it's going backwards to what they should be doing before they even get their people should think about when they can vote where there's where the fewest number of people will be there and in 20 States today. The polls are still open for early voting. So I think I'd recommend going today as opposed to Morrow. There's less density of the of the crowds if you go tomorrow then try to vote at a time when most people aren't there, we know that people", " Go to the polls and before work or during lunch or after after work is over. So if you can go mid-morning mid-afternoon there less people there. Yeah, before you go you should you bring your pain bring if you need to plan ahead bring a chair. If you need it, bring 60% hand sanitizer or hand sanitizer with more percent alcohol to be safe and look at the sample ballot before you go know who you're going to vote for know what the ballot questions are so that when you're inside,", " Where the risks are higher than outside you can get in and get out quickly. So that's what I do before you go. But when you're at the pole, then you know follow the things that we're supposed to be following all along wear a mask whether or not your state requires it it's important for everyone and protects your neighbor and you and the second thing you should do is keep your distance when you're in line, make sure that you stay six feet away or more from others and it doesn't matter if people are wearing masks you still need to stay away from them by at least", " Six feet, you know, and then before you go into the polls or out of the polls, make sure you use hand in hand sanitizer. Yeah, I should say and my polling station early voting last week. Everybody was being extremely careful and everyone is being very respectful of each other. It was very encouraging so hopefully that's being replicated around the country as you've heard. Dr. Fouch. He has said in recent days that that he fears were in for a whole lot of hurt in the coming weeks and that we could not be positioned more poorly.", " What do you fear is ahead of us at this point?", " Yeah, unfortunately with the way that the numbers are rising on a daily and weekly basis, I think we're headed for very high numbers of cases more hospitalizations and higher numbers of people dying from this disease. I think it's not a foregone conclusion. I think we do still have our fate in our hands but Governors and other leaders are going to have to change direction in places where cases are surging and people are going to have to change the way that they're acting and change their decision.", " In places where people where the cases are surging we're at a hundred thousand square 200,000 cases a day. You think it can go a lot higher than that?", " There is no set Peak for this virus. This virus is looking for people to infect. That's what it does. It hasn't changed since the very beginning and we know that most of the country still is susceptible to this virus is still vulnerable to this virus. So the thing that's going to change it isn't the virus but it's what we decide to do. It's whether we decide to wear masks whether we decide to distance ourselves to not Gather in large numbers, we have to do those things ourselves to change the course. Dr. Tom ingoldsby.", " Thank you so much for being with us."], "confidence": [0.8835903406143188, 0.8436839580535889, 0.8202160000801086, 0.9112836718559265, 0.9128395318984985, 0.7225823998451233, 0.8468641638755798, 0.9076526165008545, 0.7290212512016296, 0.8672046065330505, 0.7802017331123352]}}, "text_detection": {"text": ["MORE THAN 1 MILLION BALLOTS CAST IN NYC & MORE THAN 3.5 MILLION NJ RESIDENTS HA 8:21 / 41\u00b0", "PARTIES FIELD CANDIDATES FOR PUERTO RICO GOVERNOR SEAN CONNERY S WIDOW SA 8:24 / 41", "OURS A DAY FOR LOCAL NEWS 8 ALTERNATE SIDE PARKING & METER RULES IN EFFECT TOOL 8:23 / 41\u00b0", "ALTERNATE SIDE PARKING & METER RULES IN EFFECT TODAY IN N' 8:23 / 41\u00b0", "ATE SIDE PARKING & METER RULES IN EFFECT TODAY IN NYC 8 ELECTION DAY IS TOMORROW 8:21 / 41", "* SEATS A RECORDS PARTIES FIELD CANDIDATES FOR PUERTO RICO GOVERNOR SEA! 8:24 / 41\u00b0", "NEW MASK MANDATE BEGINS AT ALL PORT AUTHORITY FACILITIES & GAS EXI 8:24 / 41\u00b0", "ERED FROM DEMENTIA", "11-17-18-20-25 & NJ PICK 3: 1-9-0.
