We can use Virtual care mechanisms off-site screening things like that. So what is Canada's medical system, do you think actually need to stock up on at the moment? Yeah.

We're seeing a real Spectrum in terms of what they need right from something just like supplemental oxygen.", " Nation right up through an ICU bed and ventilation. So we're really having conversations at the hospital level to look at what capacity we have for ICU beds and for ventilators as an example.
