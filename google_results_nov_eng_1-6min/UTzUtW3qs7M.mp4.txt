And nor should they be a concern to the public that's too", "For Nathan grubaugh. He's an assistant professor of epidemiology at the Yale School of Public Health and his lab studies something called genomic epidemiology. We sequence viruses to understand their genetic code and their genetic relatedness and based on that genetic relatedness. Like how you would construct a a family tree. We make these phylogenetic trees and that helps us to understand how outbreaks in different regions are actually connected. His methods have been applied.", " Lied to other viral epidemics like zika and Ebola, so he's familiar with studying how viruses spread and mutate.", " We like to say that we Embrace mutations versus fear them because the collection of them end up becoming this very powerful tool for us that reveals a lot of hidden information. So that is what my lab is doing now is we're sequencing viruses from Connecticut and collaborating with people from around the world to construct these very large phylogenetic trees so that we can see the true patterns of spread. We can investigate if the viruses that are causing outbreaks in Connecticut and other regions", " These are being caused by domestic importations or if they're being caused by International implications. So we have a study right now that's on men archive in is in review that is done just that and we found that the outbreak in Connecticut is actually phylogenetically linked to the outbreak in Washington state.
