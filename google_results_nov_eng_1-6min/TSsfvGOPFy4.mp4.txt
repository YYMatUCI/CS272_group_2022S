We're making a series of videos for those who are struggling with mental health who are forced to self quarantine right now due to covid-19 these videos include topics such as managing cycles and triggers during this time the importance of maintaining a routine and then this video is going to be all about managing anxiety related to the outbreak. It's very easy and understandable to get carried away with your thoughts. If you're stuck at home constantly watching the news cycle and getting", "Worried and more and more anxious about covid-19 that really makes sense. So this video is all about how to deal with those kind of feelings of anxiety that you may be experiencing one important reminder is to practice mindfulness mindfulness is simply being in the present moment taking it as it comes not clinging to the present moment not begging for the past or hoping for the future but just being comfortable in the present can be really hard to do but with practice you can get it and it can really help improve your mindset some examples of ways to practice mindfulness might be", "Chin, or even just breathing in and out something that's really simple to start with is just feeling your body. You feel your body in the chair you're sitting in now, if you're lying in bed watching this video on your phone. Do you feel your body and where it touches the bed different things like that? What Sensations does your body feel that can bring you back to the present moment and hope you get out of your head and it's really important to practice that during Times Like These another skill you can use as checking the facts is your brain running away without you and control are you thinking about everything that's going to happen?", " But hasn't happened yet that you don't know will happen while it's important to be prepared and make sure that you're on top of what may happen getting caught up in those thoughts about the future isn't always helpful. So there's a line between preparing and obsessing make sure that you're able to stay in the present as much as possible and check the facts that you actually know for a fact are happening right now.", " It's really understandable to be feeling anxious right now. And sometimes we might beat ourselves up for feeling anxious even though it's a very valid feeling to have so it's really important to practice self validation. That's basically just telling yourself that you feel anxious right now. And that's okay when you acknowledge that feeling it should help it go down and temper it a little bit and when you deny it and say don't feel so anxious. It's not helping that can make it go up by acknowledging and self validating your feelings of fear. Anxiety worry all totally.", " All it in this situation. You can really help manage them a little bit better. Now that we've gone over some skills. There's some resources that I would like to share with you in case you need them. So I'm going to be reading from a screen. Bear with me one resource for you is to contact the samsa samhsa disaster distress helpline, and that number is 1-888-936-3264 five days a year crisis counseling and support to people experiencing emotional distress related to Natural.", " Natural or human cause disasters. So that's one resource that you can use. So with those skills and resources in mind. I hope that you feel a little bit better equipped to manage any anxiety experienced due to covid-19. It's a scary time but we can really get through this together and by being flexible by practicing really important mental health skills and by using the resources available remember all feelings pass and this is temporary and if you're feeling really anxious that will pass to and you'll feel something else soon.
