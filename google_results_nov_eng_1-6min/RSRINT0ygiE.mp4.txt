I'm here today with dr. Casey wolfington know everybody in the community. I think knows Casey. Luckily we get to work with Casey every day. And one thing that we've been talking with Casey is how do we deal with the anxiety and the fear that we all have and so here's here's a situation that I'd love to for Casey to share some of our thoughts but the situation is covid is here to stay. Unfortunately. It's endemic no amount of time that we wait is covid-19.", "Disappear in this community and until there's a vaccine which could be a year 18 months to even two years. We're going to have to learn how to deal with it and live with it and get back to some order of normalcy. So for the past two months now, we've been scaring people stay at home. We know it's a dangerous disease. We want them to be protected. But how do we now transition back into some normalcy? Right? Well a couple things like you mentioned I think scaring and fear was really productive. Yeah, it allowed us to", " Emmitt our interactions flatten our curve and really be very productive in responding to covid-19. The problem with that is now we're starting to see other things escalate. We're seeing lack of connection. We're seeing increased in behavioral health concerns people that have unsafe environments at home are starting to really have some serious concerns home isn't always safe for people. That's a really good point and connection is really important. I think the other thing is that as humans were not", " Be great at assessing risk our emotions get incredibly involved and covid-19 S been very emotional every single time. We turn on the news. There's a human interest or story that tugs at our heartstrings locally. All of us have had and probably some sort of impact from somebody being infected hospitalized possibly passing away as a result of that and that creates a lot of emotion around it, which makes us feel that the risk is so much bigger than it is.", " And I think the other component of that is we're now starting to know that covid-19 has been in our community for a long at least three months. Okay. So at least three months and we have been under social distancing orders for seven weeks seven weeks. And so the fact is that our risk to covid was here for at least five to six weeks prior to all of this lockdown, but when we're re-engaging into society, we really feel like the risk is so much greater now and and", " How do ways we're actually way more protected now, we know how transmission occurs we know ways to protect ourselves. We know the importance of hygiene and face masks and different pieces and so in a lot of ways, we don't see how we're actually should be a little more calm than we were in January. So one other thing we have is we have a great testing mechanism. Yeah up until March 4th. We had no way to test for Coronavirus in this community. We now have testing across the entire Valley and again,", " If people are sick, or they think they have covid they all I need to do is go get tested and within 48 hours. We know if they have it and we know what they need to do, which is in stay home isolate and talk to their doctor if they get worse. I think that as a mental health piece is key that hey if you're worried you have it we can now tell you yeah, exactly. Absolutely and if we do if we again go back to February January when people were starting to have symptoms that they would probably have that wait and see yeah they're going", " Work there in small rooms with their colleagues. They're not doing any precautions, but the fact is that we have the knowledge to protect ourselves. So we're in a much better spot. Right and we've tamper down the virus significantly in this community or the past seven weeks by everybody just doing a really great job of not only social distancing but the things you talked about wearing a mask when in public washing your hands and so keep it all that in mind. Maybe we should look forward a little bit more optimism going forward and maybe", " And a way to handle some of these fears absolutely and being able to connect as a community again social connection is so incredibly important is actually the most strong predictor of Health outcomes, right? So so with that we want everybody to continue stay connected in a safe appropriate way. Yeah, and we're optimistic about the future here in this Valley and grateful for what everybody's doing. Yeah.
