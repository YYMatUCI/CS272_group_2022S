I am also thinking about these same questions so far the one bright spot about covid-19 appears to be that children do not appear to be very severely affected. It is definitely possible that children are getting this infection and do not have a lot of symptoms and are still spreading to other people so they may have much more mild symptoms.", " Seems most of the strategies to keep your family safe from covid-19 are actually the same strategies that you follow to keep your family safe from influenza every year. So everyone should be washing their hands a lot using hand sanitizer a lot every time you and your family come back to your house from being out and about make it a habit to send everyone straight to the sink to wash their hands with soap and water you can talk to your kids school and be sure that they have hand sanitizer available for kids at school and they may also consider having wipes available for kids.", " Wipe down their desks periodically during the day as well. We know kids are not good about not touching their face and not touching anything they want to so it's important that they keep cleaning their hands frequently another important strategy to protect your family and to protect other families is to keep children who are sick at home. So if your kid develops cold symptoms runny nose, cough fever. Keep them home from school and keep them home from other locations where they might be exposed to lots of other kids or two other adults covid-19.", " 18 infection is still very rare in Missouri right now. So if your child has any of these symptoms, it is more likely that they have influenza or some other respiratory virus. If you are concerned about your child's health, the best thing to do is to call your pediatrician don't go straight to your pediatricians office without calling because they may want to put in place protections to keep other people in their waiting room and their own staff safe and protected from a possible infection and don't go straight to the emergency room either unless your child is having a", " a medical emergency in which case of course go straight to the emergency room.
