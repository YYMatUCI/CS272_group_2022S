My name is Isaac George. I'm in the department of surgery. I wanted to tell you a little bit about my experience with covid in mid-march. I got sick and I recovered and I was going to tell you a little bit about some of the personal aspects to my recovery and how it's affected what I do at work. So I'll start off by telling you on Sunday evening and again in mid-march. I started to.", " Not feel well. I had a mild cough the next day on Monday. I felt worse. I started to have some some low-grade fevers and that night. I actually ended up sleeping on the couch Tuesday morning. I definitely knew something was wrong. I had fevers they were up to 101. I had severe myalgias I was tired and I really just didn't want to move around. I didn't really have a cough but I had headaches and I don't really get headaches and they were", " Double headaches pretty severe. So I knew something was wrong. I was lucky enough to get tested at a local facility just across the street from my apartment and I actually took all my things and I left our apartment. I left my family and I was lucky enough to have an apartment available our in-laws apartment and they were not there and so I was able to go to my in-laws apartment and I stayed there so over the next three to four days. I was waiting for the test to come back. I", " You to have fevers low-grade that was you know, somewhat controlled with Tylenol. I continue to have myalgias and I just didn't want to move around. I didn't really feel like eating much. I slept a lot. I had headaches and everything seemed to slowly get better after 3 to 4 days. I had some mild GI distress. It was a little bit of a slow recovery, but it certainly wasn't as severe as some of the cases that we're seeing in the hospital obviously and it was", " But I would consider clearly a mild case of covid but it did take some energy out of you and I did lose, you know, five to seven pounds, which is a lot for me and overall. It did get better the test came back positive after about a week or so. I felt significantly better and I made the decision to come back home at that point in wearing a mask at home and keeping it again keeping isolated from my family to some extent.", " At that time the recommendation was you could come back to work if you're asymptomatic and not having fevers my spend an extra week out of work at the time. It was not that busy and so I felt that it was reasonable to stay stay home. And after two weeks. I came back to work in terms of how this has changed what I do in the hospital. We've had a significant reduction in cardiac surgery. So it's not as if we've been busy busy with operating a", " As point so it's been a different situation for us. I've been working in the ICU taking care of covid patients and our new icus and that's taken up the majority of my time. And then the rest of the time we've been working on academic projects. I felt well and I feel totally back to normal at this point.", " And you know in terms of the energy that's come back. I've gone running before and it's maybe not as good as it used to be but it's closed. I have used the same precautions that I've had before, you know, having recovered doesn't necessarily mean that you're immune I have gotten tested and I do have antibodies. But again, I think we're still trying to figure out what kind of immune or do you really have what these?", " Base and it's not clear. If you can get another infection again, or the the length of immunity with the antibody. So regardless I keep with full recommendations and I wear all of the PPE that we need to for taking care of patients to some extent. I think it's allowed me to have a little bit more freedom and I you know very it's been important for me to come back to work to give me something to do one as well as to ensure that", " that may be other providers who may be at higher risk don't necessarily need to come into the hospital. I understand that we've had a lot of people who've been really sick. Some of our colleagues have been extremely sick and it's important for us to understand that in terms of how bad it was, you know, it was worse than the flu. It was probably along the lines of the worst flu that I've had but just for you know, four days four to five days and really after the", " To six day. I got better and so it lasted a week and I've had the flu which is lasted more than a week and I've had sinus infections that have that have been worse. So in a scale of one to ten I would say it was a seven to eight. And so I think that's the majority of the cases that are out there probably 70 to 80% of the cases that are out there are similar to mine or maybe even a symptomatic complete.", " I'm very again grateful and lucky to be in the position that I'm in."], "confidence": [0.8990930914878845, 0.9107425212860107, 0.8307244181632996, 0.7550522685050964, 0.9037391543388367, 0.8352934718132019, 0.8728934526443481, 0.7760816812515259, 0.794527530670166, 0.7585611939430237, 0.8251134157180786, 0.8310152888298035]}}, "text_detection": {"text": [], "text_segment": {"timeoffset": [], "confidence": []}}}
