This virus has not only received widespread media coverage, but also caught the attention of scientists who have been busy analyzing.", "In the virus the disease it causes and how it spreads there is already an enormous amount of information available about the virus. And that is why we thought to summarize some of the information in this video. First of all, what do we know about the virus coronavirus has received a name from their appearance in electron micrographs where the pronounced Spike like protrusions create the effect of a Corona letting for Crown", " The genetic material inside the coronavirus is RNA and the entire genome is almost 30,000 bases long pack together with the nucleoprotein into the viral particle of the Orion.", " For the virus to replicate however, it needs to insert its RNA into cells and hijack the cellular Machinery to produce new viruses.", "", " On its surface the virion contained three main proteins the envelope the hemagglutinin esterase and the spike protein. These are embedded into a lipid bilayer the large Spike protein is responsible for the crown like protrusions, but it also recognizes the corresponding receptors on human cells called a stupa protease aids to mediate the cleavage of the spike protein which then releases an epitope and enabling the subsequent Fusion of the virus with the human cell.", " Earth"], "confidence": [0.0, 0.898198664188385, 0.900702714920044, 0.8717248439788818, 0.8927819728851318, 0.0, 0.8233334422111511, 0.36628425121307373]}}, "text_detection": {"text": ["Nucleocapsid", "3CL4", "5X29", "Crystal structure of bovine coronavirus", "ENA", "bi.lut", "i", "E-protein", "spike protein", "NMR structure of the SARS Coronavirus E", "PNA", "b", "RNA", "bi.", "Produced by biolution GmbH", "2GIB", "Prefusion structure of a human coronavirus", "Animation:", "Crystal structure of the SARS coronavirus", "biolution", "Hemagglutinin", "AN", "Iris Gr\u00fcnert", "Stefan Gr\u00fcnert", "Christian M\u00fcller", "biolution GmbH", "5108", "Scientific Advice:", "protein", "NA", "hemagglutinin-esterase", "Production:", "***2350", "nucleocapsid protein dimerization domain", "REFERENCES", "protein pentameric ion channel", "CREDITS", "\u00a9 biolution GmbH", "@000", "AT"], "text_segment": {"timeoffset": [["start_time: 72.6, end_time: 78.24"], ["start_time: 124.68, end_time: 129.72"], ["start_time: 124.68, end_time: 129.72"], ["start_time: 124.68, end_time: 129.72"], ["start_time: 79.8, end_time: 79.8"], ["start_time: 3.24, end_time: 3.36"], ["start_time: 5.16, end_time: 5.28"], ["start_time: 99.12, end_time: 105.12", "start_time: 119.64, end_time: 123.96"], ["start_time: 124.68, end_time: 129.72"], ["start_time: 124.68, end_time: 129.72"], ["start_time: 81.72, end_time: 81.84"], ["start_time: 2.4, end_time: 2.52"], ["start_time: 80.4, end_time: 80.4", "start_time: 80.52, end_time: 81.36"], ["start_time: 2.64, end_time: 3.12"], ["start_time: 130.2, end_time: 135.48"], ["start_time: 124.68, end_time: 129.72"], ["start_time: 124.68, end_time: 129.72"], ["start_time: 130.2, end_time: 135.48"], ["start_time: 124.68, end_time: 129.72"], ["start_time: 3.48, end_time: 5.64"], ["start_time: 99.0, end_time: 105.24", "start_time: 119.64, end_time: 124.08"], ["start_time: 79.32, end_time: 80.52"], ["start_time: 130.2, end_time: 135.6"], ["start_time: 130.2, end_time: 135.48"], ["start_time: 130.2, end_time: 135.48"], ["start_time: 135.24, end_time: 135.48"], ["start_time: 124.68, end_time: 129.72"], ["start_time: 130.2, end_time: 135.48"], ["start_time: 72.72, end_time: 78.24"], ["start_time: 80.04, end_time: 80.04"], ["start_time: 124.68, end_time: 129.72"], ["start_time: 130.2, end_time: 135.48"], ["start_time: 78.0, end_time: 78.12"], ["start_time: 124.68, end_time: 129.72"], ["start_time: 124.68, end_time: 129.72"], ["start_time: 124.68, end_time: 129.72"], ["start_time: 130.2, end_time: 135.6"], ["start_time: 130.2, end_time: 135.12"], ["start_time: 131.16, end_time: 131.28", "start_time: 133.8, end_time: 134.76"], ["start_time: 4.32, end_time: 5.04"]], "confidence": [[1.0], [0.997471272945404], [1.0], [1.0], [0.714633584022522], [0.7181625962257385], [0.7677551507949829], [0.9965107440948486, 1.0], [0.9979255795478821], [1.0], [0.7432896494865417], [0.8698587417602539], [0.7739037275314331, 0.7528197765350342], [0.763866126537323], [1.0], [0.9956857562065125], [1.0], [1.0], [0.9993718266487122], [0.9831758737564087], [1.0, 0.9977931976318359], [0.8077056407928467], [0.9996618628501892], [1.0], [1.0], [0.9806833267211914], [0.9956021308898926], [0.9996159672737122], [0.9950866103172302], [0.8185433149337769], [0.9987555146217346], [0.9998583197593689], [0.7269210815429688], [0.99969482421875], [1.0], [0.9996854066848755], [0.99711674451828], [0.9511111378669739], [0.772363543510437, 0.7453604936599731], [0.7557032704353333]]}}}
