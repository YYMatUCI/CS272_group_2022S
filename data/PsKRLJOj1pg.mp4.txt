How does it feel to be home?", " Feels amazing being at the hospital for such a long time and by yourself because you're not allowed visitors really takes a toll on you at some point. So I'm really happy. I'm back home and eat like home food and be with my girlfriend and my things it's really helps with the recovery. For sure that fantastic when you said you in the hospital for some time weeks and weeks you contracted coronavirus when you are on a trip to San Martin back in mid-march and when you got home, I know you became very ill very", " We fast what were your symptoms how do they progress first symptoms were pretty like flu-like symptoms mild, but then as the days go the went by it went worse and worse and worse at some point fever was out of control. I was almost at 40 I couldn't like handle myself properly. I couldn't walk properly and then my breathing became really really problematic. So we decided to call 911. Well, first of all, we call 811", " 114 to get more information if we should go there or not and then they told us to definitely call 911.

I'm not going to feel the pain for a while. So and I might even wake up better. I might die but at that point it was it was really neat.", " Desperate Measures, so I was like just do what you have to do. But that point I might die. I mean the vast majority of people Juliana who do go on to a ventilator do in fact pass away. They don't survive what did doctors tell you about how close you were to death and why you were able to pull through they don't tell you because they don't want you to panic.
