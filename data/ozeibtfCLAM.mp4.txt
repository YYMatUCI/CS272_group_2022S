I think it's this it's a couple of things one is this disruption of normal life and and and it fits because the people who are most disrupted other ones who have in the most difficulty and then I think that falls on younger people as well teenagers and young adults and things like that.

There are some people who tend to be a little more introverted or little shy or a little more inclusive actually find that find it awful, you know, there's less pressure to do things, but that's a that's not a big part of the population.", " Okay, now obviously we have a mental health problem and we've had it prior to covid-19 how have patients who are already struggling with anxiety depression and other disorders reacted to just even more stressed now.", " With a lot of difficulty. I think what I'm seeing is that people who've been fairly stable are much less. So right now, you know about the change medication regimens we've had to increase the frequency of counseling sessions.
