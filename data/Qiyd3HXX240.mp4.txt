I'm a second year medical student at MUSC and a leader of the community vulnerability project. Today's topic is the MUSC covid-19 epidemiology intelligence project. I'm joined by. Dr. Michael Sweat The Faculty director of the MUSC Center for Global Health after sweat. Thank you for joining me.", " At my pleasure. Thank you for having me. My first question is what is the MUSC covid-19 epidemiology intelligence project?", " Yeah, the project is really set up to do three main things one is to do ongoing analysis and interpretation of the status of the epidemic in terms of key indicators secondly to provide an easy to work with dashboard that's color coded that gives guidance to policy makers and leaders in terms of sort of starting and stopping mitigation efforts. And thirdly we have summary of mathematical modeling results both the", " Institute for health metrics and evaluation the I hme model, which is a model that's been sort of used nationally and it has South Carolina focus on that. And also we have our own internal mathematical model to examine the impact potential impact on the hospital operations. And what are the goals of this project?", " Yeah, I think they're kind of two main goals one is to provide regular updates and information to people on the covid epidemic and that's including everything from the broad population in town. We have a lot of people who regularly check the website but also Business Leaders policy leaders Emperor and in particular MUSC leadership and and how that could affect our own operations and secondly, I think to provide a concise", " Interpretation for policymakers in terms of making decisions as I mentioned a minute ago related to mitigation efforts, like sort of wind to reduce them or wind to reinstitute them. We may be facing what are some of the key indicators that are being assessed by this project. Right? We've have we have quite a few of them. We particularly look at the growth rate in the number of new cases that are identified and we do seven-day averages on that and compare them over time. So we do Trend analysis and those are very important indicators for where the", " Epidemics going we also look at things like population prevalence of reported cases. We have markers there for the availability of testing and how quickly the testing or getting reported back. We also have capacity of the hospital to care for patients and the number of beds and ventilators and PPE and those kind of things. We also track measures of social distancing and Mobility which are very interesting. We keep track of particular outbreak and super spreader events that are reported and we also", " now are integrating measures on contact tracing and the availability of contact tracing what is an example of how these results from your project have affected the operations of MUSC Health, you know back in March relieve which really wasn't that long ago. We were very uncertain where things were going and we work very closely with the hospital system in terms of making those sorts of estimations that I talked about. So we developed a variety of scenarios sort of a one-step was", " He sort of severe epidemic that would happen quickly and also severe epidemic that what happened over a much longer period of time and then and then also just the opposite of that sort of less severe quick less severe over a long period of time and we use those scenarios to help the hospital system. Do things like prepare for the number of beds. They might need to make sure the supplies and PPE. We're going to be adequate this project Focus only on the Charleston area or are there other parts of South Carolina being modeled as well? Yeah.", " Yeah, we started with just Charleston but you know MUSC has a presence in three main areas of the state here in Charleston, but also in the Florence area there to hospitals up in the Florence area. And then also in the Lancaster area there to hospitals up there too. So we added both Florence and Lancaster as well. So all three of those are examined and we have all them indicators in the modeling results for all three places and these results. Are they available online where people can access it and if", " How can they get this data? Yeah, they are online. We have a website. We update that website with the results a weekly on Wednesdays. We that reflects the past week from the Tuesday before that Wednesday. Think it's very easy. If they just do a web search for the MUSC covid-19 epidemiology project. It'll pop right up so much for your insight into this project doctor sweat pleasure. Thanks a lot for having me on today.
