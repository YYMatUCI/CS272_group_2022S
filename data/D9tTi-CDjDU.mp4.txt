This makes coronavirus has much more stable with a slower mutation rate than", " our RNA viruses are this may sound formidable. Thus low mutation rate is actually a promising sign when it comes to disarming them after an infection. Our immune systems can recognize germs and Destroy them more quickly if they infect us again, so they don't make us sick. The mutations can make a virus less recognizable to our immune systems and therefore more difficult to fight off. They can also make antiviral drugs and vaccines less effective because they're tailored very specifically.", " You a virus that's why we need a new flu vaccine every year the influenza virus mutates. So quickly that new strains pop up constantly. Thus low mutation rate of coronavirus has means our immune systems drugs and vaccines might be able to recognize them for longer after infection and therefore protect us better still. We don't know how long our bodies remain immune to different coronavirus has there's never been an approved treatment or vaccine for a Coronavirus.", " We haven't focused on treating the ones that cause colds and though scientists began developing treatments for SARS and mares the epidemics ended before those treatments completed clinical trials as we continue to encroach on other animals habitats.
