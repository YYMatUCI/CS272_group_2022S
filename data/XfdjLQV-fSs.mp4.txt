My name is dr. Ram you Letty and the chief physician executive at Community Health Network want to give a brief update today about all the activity that's going on with covid-19. I know there's a lot of anxiety a lot of questions a lot of concerns and so want to kind of lay out what's going on and what we think we should be doing at this time. First and foremost is many of you baby. Maybe understand the who recently said his now pandemic. What a pandemic means is that there is a new", "He's in the world. That's affecting the majority of countries and is continuing to be transmitted from person to person. One of the main reasons that the who has declared pandemic they stated is that they are very concerned that there's a significant amount of inaction in terms of what we're doing to deal with it. So let me explain that because I know some of you are thinking well, what do you mean an action sounds like we're going overboard The Other Extreme. So the biggest issue about about covid-19 is that there's a new infection for which we have no treatment.", " And so for those people that are most vulnerable and I mean people that are older than 60 if you get covid-19 infection, if you end up getting a pneumonia, we don't have any treatments for it. We don't have any antibiotics antiviral medications. All we could do is what's called supportive care and hope your body can fight the disease and recover from it. So that's the reason why it's so critical. We already know studies from China and Japan if you're really below age 30 or below each 50, you're not going to get sick. You're not going to die from it, and we already know that so it's not about it.", " Is it going to affect me but it's about me and everybody else are going to be affecting. So the reason we're trying to be so aggressive with this is to try to minimize. The number of people that are the elderly are going to get sick from it. And so the more aggressive we could be early on. Hopefully they'll be less patients that actually end up having problems with it at the end. So it's the transmission of the disease that we really want to minimize. So people that have children or feeling otherwise healthy thinking well, what do I need to do the most important thing to do if you're having symptoms of flu like illness or cough or colder temperature?", " Is it is restrained yourself is seclude yourself, whether your child middle-aged any age so you don't spread the disease again all children and I'll most adults will get through just fine. But the most important you can do for society is to make sure the elderly don't get this infection or people have other significant health problems last series. We'll try and do this is that if we don't do this this will rapidly spread and we're going to have significant issues trying to take care of these people for as matter of as a point of fact and Italy right now, there's so many elderly that have been infected they're running.", " The ventilators to help with those people just in the city of Indianapolis yesterday. There was a several hour meeting where all the Indianapolis clinicians came together and deciding if we can run the same situation when we run out of ventilators, how do we ration the ventilators what I'm hoping, you know, if we could at all possible is prevent this and prevent the spread of disease so we don't reach that point. So we're urging people is to use common sense. If you have symptoms stay inside keep yourself secluded until the symptoms go away and if we could do that early on in be very", " Rod about it that hopefully will spread limit the spread of the
