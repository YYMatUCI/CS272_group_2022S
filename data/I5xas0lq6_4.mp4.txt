She was sent home after 21 days in the hospital. You never had any medical problems before this. No serious cases, like Carla's are rare complicating the efforts of investigators. We have much less experience because the children are just getting less 6, so there are many fewer children interacting with the healthcare system and being tested. Dr. Tina Harmons.", " Richard A. Vanderbilt school of medicine is leading a new NIH study remotely monitoring about 2,000 children and their families in 11 cities Nationwide. She says that more data should be collected before a decision is made to send kids back to summer camp or school. I think it's really risky to base decisions about this based on the fact that children get less sick from this virus because that does not equal children being less likely to transmit the virus. We're not completely", " Your what are the risk factors for why these children get sick with covid? Dr. Adrian Randolph is leaving a separate CDC funded study at Boston Children's Hospital.

It can become very severe in less than a day.", "", " The New York City Department of Health says there are 15 children in the hospital with a very rare inflammatory syndrome that they're saying is potentially associated with the coronavirus. It can evolve fever rash low blood pressure and inflammation of the blood vessels including the coronary arteries.", " Boy Terra. So in one of the more fortunate aspects of this outbreak, is that although we have seen some severe cases children generally have more mild symptoms. Do we know why?", " It's really fascinating Tony and the experts say we don't there are a couple of theories one has to do with the fact that children may have less of those Ace receptors or less functional Ace receptors. These are the receptors in the lungs that the virus attaches to and gets into the cells. That may be why they don't get sick. Another theory has to do with the fact that children are exposed all the time to lots of other coronavirus has the ones that cause the common cold so they may be developing antibodies to those that are cross reactive to covid-19.", " 18 and therefore helping them and the last has to do with the fact that their immune system may be primed just right so they don't have that overwhelming cytokine storm and hyper reactive response that's causing a lot of adults to get into trouble with covid-19, but really lots of questions remain.", " Yeah, very interesting.
