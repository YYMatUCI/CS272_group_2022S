Vice President, Joe. Biden will continue to make their final appeals to voters in campaign appearances today Face the Nation moderator Margaret Brennan has interviewed both candidates and she joins us now. Good morning to you Margaret Brennan.", " Good morning to you Gail. So, you know both candidates. I know you're on calls with both campaigns last week and they're both say they feel very confident. I don't expect any candidate to say, you know, it's not looking good for us. I'm very worried but does any candidate in your opinion have reason to feel more confident than the others? We stand here today 24 hours out. Well, the Democrats can look at those banked votes that early vote and feel good about the edge. They have in certain States. But as the head of the Republican Party Ronnie McDaniel told me on Face the Nation.", " And yesterday she feels that because they have sent staff door-to-door in key States asking Republicans. Hey, why haven't you voted yet? They believe there is a surge that we haven't seen yet that will show up in person tomorrow. And if you look at States like Florida and Texas Republicans who are showing up to vote early have chipped away at some of the democratic lead in those States, but President Trump is really going to be very heavily dependent on his", " Porter's showing up in large numbers tomorrow and Joe Biden is going to be heavily dependent on those votes that are still out there particularly young voters that the Biden campaign is batting on Margaret. The the president's closing message appears to be a return to normal or return to a time before the coronavirus and yet as he makes that pitch to voters in 13 Battleground States cases of the virus are surging how do those two facts intersect in effect election day.", " Surging 45 percent over the past two weeks and those 13 Battleground States. I mean at a certain point Tony you asked how long will the president's supporters allow him to deny the facts in their own communities of spiking infection rates and hospitalization rates, but to this point and many of the president's supporters that I've spoken to when we do these voter focus groups. Tell us look it could have been worse and he's doing the best he can there's an acceptance somehow but as this gets worse heading into the winter.", " Are you wonder when the facts will overcome the politics certainly for the Biden campaign? They believe that their strongest message is to remind the public that the president didn't protect the American people against a pandemic that has killed more than 200,000 people for the Trump campaign. They continue to argue don't believe the headlines even though in States like Wisconsin, which are going to be so key for the president that inspecting infection rate could have an impact even on turnout tomorrow.", " As the governor really warns people. It's dangerous to go out. I know let's let's hit on that don't believe the headlines thing for just a second marker because now President Trump is saying that speculating out loud that he may fire Anthony falchi after the election. This is after a campaign stop where people were screaming in the crowd fire foul. She fire falchi, the president seems to be stoking that fat. She has made it very clear that this is a very dangerous time. He's telling us all be careful with your Thanksgiving plans. What do you make of that?", " Well at a certain point it becomes troubling to hear. Yeah deeply troubling to hear. Dr. Fuji himself say in that interview. He gave to the Washington Post the bit that that really struck me was when he flat out said that the president won't listen to his briefings or dr. Burke's anymore because it doesn't fit the political message. So you have the nation's top epidemiologist saying the political folks don't want to listen to the science and the facts.", " And so for a doctor who says he has no political agenda that is obviously a warning to those out there that they are at greater risk than what they are being told. So the bottom line here and dr. Gottlieb said this to us on Face the Nation yesterday at a certain point the facts are going to overcome the politics. The question is when he's saying it's going to be after the election in. Thanks that Thanksgiving period Then it is really going to hit us hard and it's going to become undeniable that we are not around.", " The curve in fact, it's coming at us hard. And that's why Margaret Brown people are feeling so stressed. Thank you very much."], "confidence": [0.8025498986244202, 0.8522030115127563, 0.7909490466117859, 0.8930085897445679, 0.7960208058357239, 0.8646870255470276, 0.8488765954971313, 0.7886773943901062, 0.7752865552902222, 0.6921253800392151]}}, "text_detection": {"text": ["NJ PICK 4:9-9-0-6.
