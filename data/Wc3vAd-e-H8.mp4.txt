The author is trying to estimate the number of hospitalized pediatric covid-19 infections in Wuhan prior to the lockdown of January 23rd, a retrospective review found that there were six children with confirmed covid-19 who are hospitalized in the period between January 7 to January 15 in all", " districts of Wuhan", " This was before the lockdown occurred during that same time. There were 43 pediatric cases of influenza who are also hospitalized in those same hospitals. The author's use that ratio between covid-19 and influenza patients to gauge the true prevalence of covid-19 in the region before lockdown. Here's how they did it. They used influenza surveillance data to estimate the number of influenza cases in the entire region during the", " That nine-day period based on the age specific ratio between covid-19 and influenza cases. They estimated the prevalence of covid-19 among the Pediatric population for the various districts of Wuhan.", " According to their estimates there could have been 313 cases of covid-19 throughout Wuhan during this nine-day period under an epidemic doubling time of 7.31 days. They estimated that there could have been as many as 1105 pediatric covid-19 hospitalizations prior to January 23rd the day when lockdown of Wuhan occurred", " this far surpasses, the 425 confirmed reported cases across all age groups of that day. None of which were children under age 15 in various Publications infections in children under 10 years of age accounted for Just Around 1% of all infections, according to this trial we might be missing something kids do get sick. We know that the rate at which they get infected could be much larger than we", " Think kids could have a much higher incidence of asymptomatic disease their symptoms could be different from what we would expect from our experience in the grown-up population. Now, what are the implications if they do get infected then closing schools is definitely a good idea similarly. If they do get infected then they will contribute to the number of cases due to their low mortality rate though. They won't contribute to the", " the number of deaths which will make the overall case fatality rate associated with covid-19 much lower. This would be a good thing.", " Another good thing if they become infected, they will also develop immunity thereby contributing to a herd immunity higher herd immunity will also cause the effect of reproductive ratio to go down which will ultimately stop the pandemic. This is the age distribution of the United States of America as of 2019 the age group of children below 10 years makes up around six percent of the American population this", " Could contribute some however not a whole lot to herd immunity. But if we take the age group of all kids and teens below 20 years, they make up around 12% of the population. This group doesn't get very sick when infected their immunity. However could significantly help to get a handle on the pandemic. This is especially true for countries with a higher proportion of children as is the case in many developing countries.", " Please note that we've just recently opened up our entire library of courses to hospitals that are taking care of covid-19 patients.
