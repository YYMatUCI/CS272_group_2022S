March for more. We're joined by Health director of the csiro. Dr. Rob grenfell. Good morning to you rob. Nice to see you. I'm doctors and nurses understandably will be the first to receive a vaccine. When will the rest of us get it.", " Yeah, good morning Carl. Anneli that that of course is the million dollar question at the moment really. It's a big task to in fact actually manufacture vaccines to the doses for the whole population. And the best way to in fact actually start. This is a staged introduction and those people most in need of having the vaccine, of course our health workers as we know the majority of cases in Australia have occurred in health workers and for us to keep our Health Care system going we need them to be in Tip-Top shape for them today.", " Talking about March it does suggest that the manufacturers are pretty confident. Yeah, look at that. It does sound like a lot of confidence as the phase 3 trials continue on and without any other Holtz, although again. I remind everybody that phase 3 is where we actually look to see how safe the vaccine is and any of these trials that are going on at the moment could halt at any moment now but being optimistic because time is running on and some of these trials will be reaching the end of their of their", " Time by the end of the round about late November is some of them and in fact most of them by end of December, which means we are going to start to see the results of those studies. I think it's complex. I just need to point out that a lot of these studies are what we call blind at studies. So we don't know who's had the vaccine and who hasn't had the vaccine and norda anyone who's doing the studies and they don't crack those codes until the end of the actual study so we don't find out the results until then so best-case scenario. What's the time?", " That we're looking at do you think the best case scenario if one of SE? The the life stage contenders actually get through this race at the moment is that we may have an announcement at the end of the year that their success they still have to go through the idea of actually manufacturing to scale. So this is what the announcement yesterday was about that CSL in Australia certainly now starting to look at the idea of commissioning the factory that will be making one of the successful potentially successful vaccine.", " He's in the Oxford AstraZeneca one under license and they will then obviously the first doses of those will probably start coming off the line in the early parts of the year, which is really what the minister was talking about yesterday those early early samples of the vaccine coming off if it's successful would be directed towards health workers. It was really interesting listening to the minister yesterday because he was talking about obviously the Oxford University and the University of Queensland vaccines, but also to others so we could potentially when they are rolled out there could be four different types.", " Vaccines that we're taking sort of depending on I guess what age we are what bracket we fall into? Yeah, look that's right. So we do have Johnson & Johnson fires a AstraZeneca have certainly some of the most developed candidates the other two can't be made in Australia because the vaccine is not made in just a vaccine Factory. It has to have a specified Factory for each vaccine and they have to have regulation and compliance to a whole range of stringent.", " And so it's not something you can just do and the big bold push here has been to actually make factories for vaccines that haven't yet been proven so they may actually not be made. So we're looking at vast sums of money going into making factories that may not be used in that sort of setting but hey, the stakes are pretty high we're looking at what's happening in Europe at the moment sure are the federal government wants free movement around the country by Christmas. Is there any medical reason why that shouldn't happen. It's extremely exciting how the virus is actually been.", " Washed literally in Victoria. One of the things we need to understand is it's still circulating in the community. So we still need to maintain our social distancing and also anybody with symptoms needs to get tested. That's what you need to do in that place as that moves on I think the confidence of opening up a stray Leah for Australia's to have free passage is an exciting prospect and we're seeing that already with Western Australia talking about releasing it for some other countries and sorry other states and hopefully for", " Us victorians we can start to move out of Victoria's. Well, that'll be really exciting will be good Christmas present. Wouldn't it? Thank you, Doctor.
