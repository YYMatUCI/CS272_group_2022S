I'm seriously like I'll see you know, toilet paper hand sanitizer and my husband's like Chanel Marie like we have two drawers full of you know, let's use the toilet paper we have now, seriously. I don't know a lot of people can relate to that and we don't want to do that again. No, I don't want a repeat of what we saw in the spring not at all, but I do want people to be prepared.

So one of our viewers and Texas said what she does is she just picks up a couple extra items on each grocery trip, and then she just has enough for what she needs if that's a good tip.

So is it one of those things where we need to start reeling that in when it gets a little cooler is it?", " Fine since we're outside, you know, do we need to start having conversations with our employers like is it time to kind of perk up a little bit things are going to change as we all start to having to move indoors whether it's your kids in school or you're going back to the office. This is really the time to have the conversation if you haven't already with your employer about whether working from home continues to be an option for you if it doesn't ask about staggering your hours so that perhaps you can come in on off peak hours.

This is as you heard. Dr. John Torres say ventilation is everything so asked if the teachers can keep the windows and doors open parents also might want to consider buying room air purifiers or cleaners for their classrooms. That's something that schools will need this year. Especially the older schools that may not have those great air handling units.

Don't delay get in now. You definitely don't want to be going to the hospital for a procedure during the peak of cold flu and potentially covid-19 season. So get those appointments taken care of now and I hate to say this but consider your holiday shopping list, and maybe you want to start chipping away at it now now I know you're an early bird, but the early bird gets the worm this year think about it unprecedented demand for online shopping and you also don't really want to be in crowded indoor malls.
