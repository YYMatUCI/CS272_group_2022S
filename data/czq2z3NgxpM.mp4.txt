coronavirus spreads to more countries. It's threatening the health of the global economy. It's one of the worst weeks for the Dow since the 2008 financial crisis and we hit the streets to ask how worried you are about covid-19 s impact on the economy it all about the effect coronavirus is having on the economy, you know as a stock investor anytime. You see it go down 20% your kind of Happiness weird sensor like yes that can invest, you know, buy everything she", "At the same time, you know as someone who works at 9:00 to 5:00 job. You're like, oh Now's the Time where like people are going to start getting layoffs and everything of that. I don't think so. I don't know if it will like get to a point where it will affect it that much worried at all about the effect on the economy. Oh, I'm actually kind of worried. Yeah because it could shut down like Global Supply chains right mean we're so interior intertwined either interconnected, you know with the whole world is and thanks to everyone who stopped to chat.", " The other day. So for more on the impact is that break is having on Canada's economy. We've reached Pedro on Tunas now, he is the chief Economist at the conference Board of Canada not-for-profit Think Tank and he joins us from Ottawa Pedro. Thanks so much for your time. Especially early on a weekend morning Canadian markets took a tumble this week. How concerned are you about the fact that the covid virus continues to spread and what effect it might be having on the economy. Well, I think some of the some of the interviews", " I was here with the audience. There were right on I think the issue here. Of course is that the first the first country affected was China and China is a huge country. Now, it's a global power in terms of its consumer spending. And so we're already seeing some implications of that and we've heard about the Chinese that are the number number one outbound travel market. So that's having an impact certainly on global tourism. And on top of that. Of course, there's the supply chain. In fact that some rule dude.", " You too. So just that hoobae Province for example is the it produces 50% of LCD screens in the world. So you can imagine that if you know in the supply chains, these things are starting to be to be felt but more broadly now is that this the virus is spreading outside of China and the concern there is how how far does this go before we do contain it and it is going to have impacts across the world. Let's try and unpack some of that you talk about supply chain talk about", " Flat screens and other things but presumably Canadian consumers and even a lot of Canadian manufacturers may not be fully aware of how much of the bits and bytes of their finished product actually starts out in China, right? Well, in fact, yes, a lot of Manufacturers don't know how deep their supply chains run. We do know that we're very much integrated within North America. So we tend to look South when we think about Supply chains, but we cannot ignore that in terms of chemical.", " Flies in terms of some of these parts for electronics in terms of some of the minerals even a lot of this does come from China and from other parts of the world, so we're not immune to that and I think you know, just when we think about China as a the biggest the second biggest economy in the world, you know, this is going to have an impact globally which will have repercussions for Canada, you know, we're exporting economy. We depend on the global economy. So this is going to have further impacts. We certainly saw some effects.", " The stock market, although many have pointed out that maybe there was some froth that needed to be taken off the top anyway, and that would have happened it at some point. But in terms of the effect on Canadian consumers, how long do you think it'll be before that effect is palpable.", " You know, it's well, I mean we in Canada were lucky we came off a very good year for employment in 2019 wages are pretty healthy or growing fairly strongly. So in terms of the income signed, you know, we're in pretty good shape heading into this the problem. Is that the kind of Fear Factor and this is something that economists and many others have become very aware of since the 2008-2009 recession The Fear Factor can have huge implications for consumer confidence business confidence and that can play itself out now.", " Remind people that these types of viral kinds of kind of global viral infections in the past. They have been followed by a big rebound. So hopefully we'll be able to contain this before it has a too much further reach and we hopefully will see that similar kind of pattern rebounding and consumer spending etcetera when people do finally breathe easier about the virus until we get to that rebound. Is there anything that the government could or should do to potentially", " Ali Stave off some of those ill effects. Well, I think right now from this is a Health crisis and I think government should really focus on that. I think with respect to the the the economy I think people should have we should try and have as much common sense about avoiding too much travel avoiding going to places where there are contagion and as individuals, I think you know health health officials would tell you stay home if you're not feeling so good and hopefully, you know, we won't see this take bite.", " Here in this country Pedro.
