We lowered infection rates and deaths", " We avoided overwhelming the healthcare system and that's great. But these data bring concerns as well. This low number of infections means we're reopening a community with low levels of immunity meaning risk of reinfection is we reopen is high especially given the number of asymptomatic people without symptoms or regular testing.

These data also tells that we were woefully underreporting infection rates, Indiana was reporting approximately 17,000 cases of covid-19 toward the", " end of April based on this study, which was designed to allow generalization of the whole state without testing everyone. That number is likely closer to a hundred eighty-six thousand. That means we were only detecting around one in every 11 cases. That means the impact of the virus here in Indiana was about 11 times greater than we suspected based on conventional testing which mostly reaches only symptomatic and high-risk people importantly. These numbers have provided the long-missing denominator needed to accurately estimate the infection fatality rate as", " The case fatality rate. It's definitely not great. Indiana's number suggest. The infection fatality rate is zero point five eight percent since there's been a lot of comparison between the virus and the flu. Now's a good time to mention that the average infection fatality rate for seasonal flu is about 0.1 percent approximately six times less deadly.

There are many factors involved in a study like this. It's complicated and that's all compounded by the fact that we need the data fast.
