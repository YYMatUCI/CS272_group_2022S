get more on that wavering guidance from the CDC by talking to our David agus who joins us now, dr. Agus good morning to you. So the CDC was already saying that the virus spreads easily and rapidly between people but it was focused on the droplets that hang in the air as opposed to these aerosols. Which float I guess four hours. How big is that distinction?", " Well, you know the droplets are within six feet when you and I speak droplets come out and we know that is the dominant mode of transmission of the virus period that being said aerosols the virus can float in the air linger longer and further that maybe a mode of transmission. It's not the dominant mode, but it may be a motive transition. We just don't know what you're seeing is the sausage being made for the first time in front of the American public, right? We are learning the science as we go in this", " New we normally know the science because viruses have been around for a long time as other diseases, but here we're learning as we go. Do you think the CDC given the challenges? It's had recently with maintaining public trust should have just kept the guidance up we heard dr. Ulster home from the University of Minnesota say actually, this is good science. It was fine. Why not publish it?", " You know, what's interesting. Is that science going up on a website and then literally a day or two later somebody finding that and putting that into the media I do think is the wrong way to go. I think that there needs to be a conversation whenever there's a change explain it in detail because there are a lot of policy implications for changing that guidance. And so I think that we deserve a conversation we deserve an explanation of what are the data and why not just to change on a website. So how would our lives change if this guidance became", " New rule at the CDC that this was a virus spreading through aerosolized particles.", " Well, it would change how we isolate patients in a hospital for example, and they would need specialized rooms and that have specialized ventilation which we don't have that many of them in the country. It would change some of the requirements for opening schools restaurants indoor places to require certain ventilation requirements that are now not always there in many of these establishments. So this is a big policy change if it goes through I think discussion needs to happen. All right, so but for the moment we're", " King droplets and we're thinking six feet no more and we await further word from the CDC and dr. De Vegas. Thank you very much.
