Let's say a person with covid-19 sneezes or exhales in front of you and you inhale the viral particles coming out of his mouth.", "The virus will then travel to the respiratory system epithelial cells of your bronchi, which are the main Airways in your lungs bronchial the smaller passageways in the most important. The tiny air sacs at the end called the alveoli are the main targets epithelial cells are like the safety Shields of the body forming a covering of all the body surfaces Unfortunately. They are prime cellular targets of the novel coronavirus because of the AC e 2 receptors which act as entry points the virus then enters the cell using the spike.", " 18 on its surface that binds on a receptor of the target cells viruses have their own genetic code, but they lack the Machinery to copy their DNA. So once inside like a trojan horse the virus then hijacks and transform the cell into a viral protein making factory the infected cells now serve the virus synthesizing thousands and thousands of varville proteins and assembling them which are later than released to enslave more cells and continue the process as the infected cells die. They release proteins called cytokines and damage associated with", " Killer patterns cytokines are like the messenger proteins which act as a signal to activate the immune system then macrophages one of the most specialized cells in the immune system gets activated the macrophages then begin to secrete inflammatory cytokines, which results in the acute inflammation inside the lung to be specific. They release il-1 il-6 and il-8 tnf-alpha and if'n Gamma these cytokines migrated to the capillaries.", " That line the alveoli capillaries are the smallest blood vessels having endothelial lining compromise of endothelial cells the inflammatory cytokines increase the spaces between the endothelial cells causing the capillaries to leak as a fluid from the capillaries start accumulating inside the alveoli becomes difficult to breathe. This condition is known as pneumonia the inability to get enough oxygen into the lungs raises the risk for developing hypoxemia, where the blood oxygen level drops.", " Carbon dioxide will start accumulating inside which is known as respiratory acidosis as there's an increase in the secretion of cytokines. It will induce the expression of a very important molecule on the endothelial lining of the blood cells called vesicular cell adhesion protein this acts as a magnet that attracts neutrophils to the site of the injury inside the alveoli neutrophils are white blood cells whose main function is to kill and clean out the invading pathogens. They kill the virus.", " By secreting protegees and reactive oxygen species, but it comes with a price which is the damage of the tissue itself.

The alveoli will collapse which will further contribute to the hypoxemia Additionally the cytokine secreted by the macrophages will result in the microscopic clotting of platelets and red blood cells called micro thrombus or a blood clot. This will lead to more hypoxemia and complete lung failure.", " As these cytokines are secreted into the system circulation. They will have a very bad effect causing abnormal blood clotting throughout the system blood clotting starts forming throughout the body blocking small blood vessels. This is known as disseminated intravascular coagulation, which is a serious Disorder. So it all began with a nasty cold and viral pneumonia from acute respiratory distress syndrome. It has progressed to pulmonary embolism and then ultimately led to multi-organ failure due to abnormal blood clotting throughout the body.", " It isn't the virus that kills you but the way that your body reacts or should I say fails to react against the virus that causes the death, although there is no 100% effective treatment as of yet.
