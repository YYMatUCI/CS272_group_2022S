cases was almost identical it took Italy six days to go from about a hundred and fifty to one thousand cases and it took Spain the exact same amount of time now March 13th, we have updated data Spain has just surpassed 4,000 confirmed.", " Cases, why was this so predictable? It's because if you have similar societies with similar Disease Control measures identical human biology and an identical virus the results can basically be predicted when Spain reached 150 cases that appeared to be about the critical mass after which contagion across countries is very similar. So to go from one case to 10 cases from Tim cases to a hundred cases. This is very hard to predict.", " Because each individual behaves very differently randomly, right? But once you're at a critical mass that Randomness kind of cancels out and so the time it takes to go from 150 to a thousand or from a thousand to ten thousand given a similar set of circumstances is going to be pretty similar across different places and different times the Italy and Spain similarities are not a one-off case. In fact, the Italian trajectory is the same trajectory being followed by the disease outbreaks.", " In most of the Western European countries and in the United States, the only difference is that Italy is a few days ahead of these these other countries the u.s. Germany France UK Denmark. We all seem to be on the Italian trajectory. Now, let's let's compare this with the outbreak in China excluding The hoobae Province these great lines on the chart to show Chinese provinces Chinese Disease Control measures social distancing active case detection.", " Cases to a minimum. So there's some Hope from China's trajectory There's Hope from other countries to let's take a look at Singapore and Japan. They went past the 150 critical mass but managed to keep growth thereafter to to a minimum and then there's South Korea even though South Korea got to some pretty high numbers since then they've taken effective measures to control the outbreak. There are a lot of variables that we don't know like the number of people that are infected but don't get tested. What", " we do know is that reactive measures are very ineffective at controlling covid-19. What we've seen in the case of china is that outside of hoobae provinces were able to keep caseload relatively Low by taking very proactive very drastic measures what we've seen so far in the outbreak in the Euro and Europe and in the u.s. Is that these reactive measures kind of piecewise slowly reacting to new cases with incremental shutdowns?", " It's quarantines doesn't seem to have been sufficient to slow the tide of the outbreak. What we do know about this disease is that it can spread very rapidly across a population and it has very high mortality rates among those who are particularly vulnerable. We also know that it has the capacity to saturate and oversaturate Health Services. So even if it doesn't necessarily kill you directly it can kill you or it can kill people.", " By virtue of having basically taken Health Services past their capacity.
