We're doing a series on covid-19. We're getting a lot of questions about this and particularly about how to stay safe how to understand the difference between aerosols and droplets what that means for healthcare providers in terms of PPE and how you can better understand how to take care of these patients that come in eating different types of oxygen delivery devices the basics start with a cough that's what these patients are coming in with their coughing and when we call for when we see", "Is we emit large droplets large droplets? If someone sitting next to you could land on somebody else they could inhale it and they could contract the virus if the large droplets land on a piece of plastic or a doorknob somebody comes along and touches that doorknob then touches their face. They could also get the virus. That's the main form of transmission of covid-19. Another thing we're paying particularly close attention to is aerosols aerosols are a bit different than large droplets aerosols are more like a Mist you can think of it like a", " a spray bottle or power washer or it have fine particles that come up to into the air and they hang out and they stay floating in the air for a longer period of time than the large droplets. This means if somebody else comes walking by they might inhale those find aerosols and get sick and get the virus. Okay. So what do we do about this? Well for starters to prevent large droplet spread we're asking people to wear masks if you cough or sneeze into a mask, there's less risk of those large droplets landing on somebody else or on a", " We're knob you get the drift for patients that are requiring devices that are going to emit aerosols. For example, a high-flow nasal. Cannula CPAP or BiPAP a ventilator where a nebulizer is going in all of these things have a risk of emitting aerosols into the room. We want as much as we possibly can those rooms to be negative air flow. We want to be turning over the air and those rooms to eliminate the aerosols as fast as possible in addition. We want providers to", " Be wearing PPE that includes an n95 tightly fitting and fit-tested mask that blocks aerosol inhalation. In addition things like eye protection gowns gloves. This is what we're recommending for covid-19. We're worried both about large droplet transmission, which is the main mechanism of transmission in our community, but in hospitals where we're seeing devices used were also worried about aerosols which is why you see a lot of attention given lately to n95 s- airflow rooms and the like thanks again for tuning in to cook.", " Care Survival Guide, please do subscribe and let us know what else you'd like to learn about.", ""], "confidence": [0.0, 0.9006850719451904, 0.9052106738090515, 0.8182051777839661, 0.8016767501831055, 0.9087634682655334, 0.6149024963378906, 0.0]}}, "text_detection": {"text": ["information presented is factual and timely.
