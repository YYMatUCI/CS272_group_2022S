There's been a lot of internet traffic around blood types, but there's no scientific evidence to my knowledge that blood types are a factor. You mention one thing. I want to play off of the you mentioned internet traffic. There's a lot of theories floating around about this and that how does that is that how harmful is that?", " Well, it can be it can be minimal or it can be seriously harmful, you know, the whole controversy around chloroquine as a treatment for this disease. We still don't know how effective that is. But you know many people took that and ran with it and look for chloroquine type compounds in household substances, and there were overdoses and you know, lots of problems associated with that. So home remedies typically are not useful.", " You know many of these theories are unproven and I think it's a situation where we don't know everything about this virus which allows people to conjecture a lot. Yeah, that's true. I guess when there's a lot of unknown people will grab onto things because there's nothing to say that's been completely disproven. All right, let's get to the next one doc. If you get coronavirus you get over it. Is that it can you get it again? So we don't think so. What happens is you", " Antibodies antibodies which are the body's mechanism for killing the virus and we are beginning now to test for antibodies, which is a more certain tests that you know, you're cured of the virus.

Okay, and your and your antibodies go away or diminish over time. So if you have it now, you know two years from now, you may not still have all that immunity. All right quick text. We're about out of time doc. How is everybody doing with dignity? The doctors nurses in Sacramento has its really hit yet or is everybody managing?", " We're managing. We began preparing months ago. We have disaster plans and all our hospitals and for our division, of course people are afraid but we have plenty of protective equipment. Now, we have testing improved testing capability.
