Now many people are wondering how to tell if they're cough is just a cold or covid-19 CBS News medical contributor. Dr. David agus joins us now with some answers to these questions. Dr. Agus. Good morning. So how do you do it? You've got a cold you've got the flu and then you've got the coronavirus there are some similarities but there are a lot of important differences. Can you walk us through them?", " Sure, Tony, so they're all viruses right coronavirus causes the common cold covid-19 obviously and then influenza A and B, cause the flu and the body's immune response to viruses causes you to have fever chills cause you to potentially have diarrhea headache and so they're they're immune response to the virus. The body doesn't care which virus it is a virus is a virus. So the similar the symptoms are remarkably similar what's unique to covid is that", " Change in taste and smell that happens in some people but but not all but the symptoms are really overlapping. So it's going to cause issue as we get into the season. So then what guidance would you give people about precisely when they should go to their doctor or at least called her doctor?", " So what these viruses do is they go into your lung and they cause inflammation in the lungs can get leaky and it can make it difficult to breathe and that's what we worry about. That's why people need to go to the doctor or the hospital when they have difficulty breathing and that classically means there's too much inflammation in the lung and at that point the doctor will do a rapid test and they can know whether the patient has flu whether the patient has covid-19 or something else like the common cold and make a decision whether that patient needs oxygen or", " Or can be monitored at home. The other is you can have a pulse ox at home and you can actually measure your own oxygen. And so if it starts to dip below 94% then it's time to call your doctor. And what is your biggest concern as we enter a period where we're going to have the flu and the coronavirus side by side. What worries you as you look at what could happen to the country?", " Well, you know in many parts of the country now where there are spikes in cases. The hospitals are starting to be full the icy user full you couple that with the flu and you have a double whammy there which really emphasizes the need for flu vaccination, you know, you can treat the flu by me prevent the flu with a vaccine in many cases and that is critical. The other key is diagnosis. Remember if you diagnose the flu early through a test, you can take a drug and Tamiflu or one of the other anti-flu drugs or give it to your family members.", " Us before they're symptomatic and they won't get sick. So it's really important that we keep testing going in the country.
