Let's see how", " The disease seems to stop with a fever followed by a dry cough around 80% of confirmed cases are mild and can stay home. Whereas 20% a more severe and need impatient care due to the pneumonia and its consequences caused by the virus.", " What's interesting is that covid-19 only rarely seems to cause a runny nose sneezing or even a sore throat, even though the sore throat seems to be a little more common.", " These symptoms commonly observed and regular codes have been observed in only about 5% of covid-19 patients.", " A paper published by Chen and co-workers in the respected journal the Lancet describe the clinical course of ninety-nine cases hospitalized for stars Covey to Associated pneumonia.", " They found that fever and cough where the most common symptoms of covid-19 followed by shortness of breath.
