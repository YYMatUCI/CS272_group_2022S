43,WkxbRfvOn6k.mp4,And we're joined Now by dr. Tom inglesby for advice on how voters can stay healthy and safe as they cast their ballots.
44,WkxbRfvOn6k.mp4,Dr. Inglesby is the director of the Center for Health security at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.
45,WkxbRfvOn6k.mp4,Good morning doctor.
46,WkxbRfvOn6k.mp4,Thanks for being with us.
47,WkxbRfvOn6k.mp4,How concerned Anthony How concerned are you about coronavirus transmission at polling stations and should people feel safe voting in person.
48,WkxbRfvOn6k.mp4,"I think if people follow simple simple instructions take normal kind of sensible actions that the risk can be as little as going to the pharmacy or going to the grocery store, but they have to think about it ahead of time plan ahead of time and then act in ways that public health suggests when they're at the at the voting voting place."
49,WkxbRfvOn6k.mp4,What about those polling stations wear masks are not required.
50,WkxbRfvOn6k.mp4,"Yeah, well in every place in the country people should be using masks when they vote."
51,WkxbRfvOn6k.mp4,I think I mean it's going backwards to what they should be doing before they even get their people should think about when they can vote where there's where the fewest number of people will be there and in 20 States today.
52,WkxbRfvOn6k.mp4,The polls are still open for early voting.
53,WkxbRfvOn6k.mp4,So I think I'd recommend going today as opposed to Morrow.
54,WkxbRfvOn6k.mp4,"There's less density of the of the crowds if you go tomorrow then try to vote at a time when most people aren't there, we know that people Go to the polls and before work or during lunch or after after work is over."
55,WkxbRfvOn6k.mp4,So if you can go mid-morning mid-afternoon there less people there.
56,WkxbRfvOn6k.mp4,"Yeah, before you go you should you bring your pain bring if you need to plan ahead bring a chair."
57,WkxbRfvOn6k.mp4,"If you need it, bring 60% hand sanitizer or hand sanitizer with more percent alcohol to be safe and look at the sample ballot before you go know who you're going to vote for know what the ballot questions are so that when you're inside, Where the risks are higher than outside you can get in and get out quickly."
58,WkxbRfvOn6k.mp4,So that's what I do before you go.
59,WkxbRfvOn6k.mp4,"But when you're at the pole, then you know follow the things that we're supposed to be following all along wear a mask whether or not your state requires it it's important for everyone and protects your neighbor and you and the second thing you should do is keep your distance when you're in line, make sure that you stay six feet away or more from others and it doesn't matter if people are wearing masks you still need to stay away from them by at least Six feet, you know, and then before you go into the polls or out of the polls, make sure you use hand in hand sanitizer."
60,WkxbRfvOn6k.mp4,"Yeah, I should say and my polling station early voting last week."
61,WkxbRfvOn6k.mp4,Everybody was being extremely careful and everyone is being very respectful of each other.
62,WkxbRfvOn6k.mp4,It was very encouraging so hopefully that's being replicated around the country as you've heard.
63,WkxbRfvOn6k.mp4,Dr. Fouch.
64,WkxbRfvOn6k.mp4,He has said in recent days that that he fears were in for a whole lot of hurt in the coming weeks and that we could not be positioned more poorly.
65,WkxbRfvOn6k.mp4,What do you fear is ahead of us at this point?
66,WkxbRfvOn6k.mp4,"Yeah, unfortunately with the way that the numbers are rising on a daily and weekly basis, I think we're headed for very high numbers of cases more hospitalizations and higher numbers of people dying from this disease."
67,WkxbRfvOn6k.mp4,I think it's not a foregone conclusion.
68,WkxbRfvOn6k.mp4,I think we do still have our fate in our hands but Governors and other leaders are going to have to change direction in places where cases are surging and people are going to have to change the way that they're acting and change their decision.
69,WkxbRfvOn6k.mp4,"In places where people where the cases are surging we're at a hundred thousand square 200,000 cases a day."
70,WkxbRfvOn6k.mp4,You think it can go a lot higher than that?
71,WkxbRfvOn6k.mp4,There is no set Peak for this virus.
72,WkxbRfvOn6k.mp4,This virus is looking for people to infect.
73,WkxbRfvOn6k.mp4,That's what it does.
74,WkxbRfvOn6k.mp4,It hasn't changed since the very beginning and we know that most of the country still is susceptible to this virus is still vulnerable to this virus.
75,WkxbRfvOn6k.mp4,So the thing that's going to change it isn't the virus but it's what we decide to do.
76,WkxbRfvOn6k.mp4,"It's whether we decide to wear masks whether we decide to distance ourselves to not Gather in large numbers, we have to do those things ourselves to change the course."
77,WkxbRfvOn6k.mp4,Dr. Tom ingoldsby.
78,WkxbRfvOn6k.mp4,Thank you so much for being with us.
79,BZHdZCmvcc4.mp4,"Hello, I'm Jane gun, Deputy dean of the faculty of medicine dentistry and Health Sciences and chief Public Health advisor for the University as we have all seen recently."

86,MycbSc8KxFU.mp4,Hi and welcome to another edition of your health with dr. Christy.
87,MycbSc8KxFU.mp4,My name is dr. Kristy Reisinger.
88,MycbSc8KxFU.mp4,And today I'm flying on a plane and I'd like to give you guys some advice on how to make it as safe as possible.
89,MycbSc8KxFU.mp4,When I first sat down in my seat.
90,MycbSc8KxFU.mp4,The very first thing that I did was disinfect just in fact every single surface that you think you're going to touch during the flight from the tray table to the window to the vent above.
91,MycbSc8KxFU.mp4,In fact everything.
92,MycbSc8KxFU.mp4,The next thing that I would recommend is either wearing the glasses that you wear normally or purchasing a cheap pair of glasses like this or wearing a face shield to protect your eyes during the flight.
93,MycbSc8KxFU.mp4,"I plan on wearing these during the entire flight, but they fog up when I talk so I'm not going to wear the right now while filming but this is what they look like and I cleaned the continue to wear them throughout the flight."
94,MycbSc8KxFU.mp4,Like I mentioned one thing that I noticed I'm flying on Southwest That they're very great about keeping the middle seat open and they also boarded more slowly in groups of 10.
95,MycbSc8KxFU.mp4,So allow more time to board.
96,MycbSc8KxFU.mp4,It took us about 45 minutes to board instead of the usual 30 minutes and I next want to talk about air quality on the plane.
97,MycbSc8KxFU.mp4,It would seem as though since in a closed space for a long period of time.
98,MycbSc8KxFU.mp4,It would be really risky.
99,MycbSc8KxFU.mp4,The airlines have always implemented some things to make the air quality safer the way they are.
100,MycbSc8KxFU.mp4,Air is circulated on the plane is in compartments.
101,MycbSc8KxFU.mp4,It doesn't flow from the front to the back of the plane.
102,MycbSc8KxFU.mp4,It actually flows from the floor to the ceiling and also the vents put out HEPA filter are really it's not about the plane itself.
103,MycbSc8KxFU.mp4,It's about the people on the plane and the people that you need to worry about most are the ones that are two rows ahead of you and two rows behind you because no matter how much they are circulated is someone coughs or sneezes.
104,MycbSc8KxFU.mp4,It can't get circulated quickly enough.
105,MycbSc8KxFU.mp4,For the have a filter to remove those particles.
106,MycbSc8KxFU.mp4,Everyone on the plane is required to wear a mask at this point what I think which I think is really helpful.
107,MycbSc8KxFU.mp4,So be sure that you come with a mass.
108,MycbSc8KxFU.mp4,They won't let you get on the plane without one and the last thing that I'd like to mention on the last plane that we wrote on.
109,MycbSc8KxFU.mp4,"The only time I felt a little bit uncomfortable is when we exited the plane, so I would try to sit at the front of the plane and exit first aired we know that the air quality tends to disintegrate the longer than a play."
110,MycbSc8KxFU.mp4,"It is parked at the gate, which is another reason to try to get off the plane as quickly as possible."
111,MycbSc8KxFU.mp4,Thanks again for joining me.
112,czlICtpYvAU.mp4,What used to be routine?
113,czlICtpYvAU.mp4,What was it four or five months ago going to work or school?
114,czlICtpYvAU.mp4,Seeing friends even grocery shopping has changed so much during this pandemic and add to that for almost everybody some level of financial stress.
115,czlICtpYvAU.mp4,Well today the health Minister Patti.
116,czlICtpYvAU.mp4,Hi do Express huge concern for the mental health of Canadians.
117,czlICtpYvAU.mp4,So while physical distancing and masks can help stop the spread of the virus or at least slow it down.
118,czlICtpYvAU.mp4,What can we do to take care of our mental help?
119,czlICtpYvAU.mp4,Well with some guidance tonight is dr. Shimmy Kang a psychiatrist and author.Based here in Vancouver and dr. Thomas Unger psychiatrist in Chief at st. Michael's Hospital in Toronto.
120,czlICtpYvAU.mp4,We got a lot of questions.
121,czlICtpYvAU.mp4,We were actually overwhelmed by the number and depth of them and Doctor Kang.
122,czlICtpYvAU.mp4,Let me put the first one to you.
123,czlICtpYvAU.mp4,Our daughters are nervous about going back to school.
124,czlICtpYvAU.mp4,They asked me why is it?
125,czlICtpYvAU.mp4,"Okay they go into a school building in September, but Dad doesn't have to go back to his office downtown."
126,czlICtpYvAU.mp4,I don't know how to reassure them doctor Kang.
127,czlICtpYvAU.mp4,What would you suggest?
128,czlICtpYvAU.mp4,Well these that's a very good curious question smart kids.
129,czlICtpYvAU.mp4,"I would say that first of all, we want to be truthful optimistic and make sure we reassured students and children that the adults are planning and in control because children experience anxiety more let them know that there are protocols between public health and school officials, but remind them that they may not be perfect that they have a voice to express any concern or caution and to work collaboratively with their teachers administrators and most of all their parents and caregivers."
130,czlICtpYvAU.mp4,"That you will be them be there to help guide them and with the tone of optimism, this is a stressful time for everyone."
131,czlICtpYvAU.mp4,Especially young people.
132,czlICtpYvAU.mp4,"Dr. King you deal with children all the time here in Vancouver and as an author as well, and I guess one of the challenges and I saw this last night on the national with some parents who right or wrong don't have confidence in the back to school plans."
133,czlICtpYvAU.mp4,So how do they deal with their children when they themselves are anxious?
134,czlICtpYvAU.mp4,Right?
135,czlICtpYvAU.mp4,And I think so being truthful is totally fine children can sense You are concerned and so you don't want to lie.
136,czlICtpYvAU.mp4,So if you do have concerns Express exactly what they are don't give them a laundry list of things that they can't do anything about and then quickly turn to practical solution.
137,czlICtpYvAU.mp4,"So, you know, I'm not quite sure social distancing has been figured out."
138,czlICtpYvAU.mp4,This is what I would like you to do.
139,czlICtpYvAU.mp4,I'm going to give you this Noodle and you can measure your space or let's practice The Mask or hand-washing so be very specific and practical at this point with young people and try not to overwhelm them with your own individual.
140,czlICtpYvAU.mp4,"Earns, dr. Unger next question to you, I think twice about leaving home and going out in public and I'm on edge whenever I'm out in public places."
141,czlICtpYvAU.mp4,I've certainly heard people say things like that.
142,czlICtpYvAU.mp4,You probably have to what's your advice?
143,czlICtpYvAU.mp4,"Yeah, so this is a weird time if you're not worried, there's something wrong with you."
144,czlICtpYvAU.mp4,So you got to validate it's normal to be anxious and worried.
145,czlICtpYvAU.mp4,It's based on reality.
146,czlICtpYvAU.mp4,There's nothing unusual about that.
147,czlICtpYvAU.mp4,But that doesn't make it an illness or anything.
148,czlICtpYvAU.mp4,It just means we have to acknowledge that accept that and then to hide out and have the anxiety overwhelming and paralyze you if we're now allowed out and we're being increasingly allowed to go out and start doing things.
149,czlICtpYvAU.mp4,It means it's time to begin dipping your toe in the shallow end and gradually moving on and getting used to a manageable amount of anxiety.
150,czlICtpYvAU.mp4,And it'll get a little better.
151,czlICtpYvAU.mp4,"You know, it's really scary at the beginning but you go with your comfort level you start exposing yourself because we have to learn to live with the anxiety and to live with the reality in a safe as possible ways."
152,czlICtpYvAU.mp4,We can so I would just acknowledge it validated but then encourage them to begin starting to gradually get out there to the degree that they can comfortably do it because it'll get a little bit better and better as they gradually expose themselves over time and dr. Unger.
153,czlICtpYvAU.mp4,Let me put the next question to you as well.
154,czlICtpYvAU.mp4,The pandemic has been absolutely horrible.
155,czlICtpYvAU.mp4,I was raised to be Hard worker having my job taken away from me is caused endless amounts of anxiety.
156,czlICtpYvAU.mp4,I want my job back.
157,czlICtpYvAU.mp4,"Yeah, so that I really feel for people like that."
158,czlICtpYvAU.mp4,I mean this really sucks.
159,czlICtpYvAU.mp4,It's got significant potential economic impacts and work impacts for a lot of people and that's just a real harsh reality.
160,czlICtpYvAU.mp4,So I understand how upset they'll be down and said if you're really negative and really feeling down and nothing gets you out of it.
161,czlICtpYvAU.mp4,Then I think you need to go get checked out contact your health provider family doctor mental health hotline because there's a slight chance that that regular down that you're supposed to feel because of The difficulty can actually slide into a mental health or medical condition we call depression.
162,czlICtpYvAU.mp4,"So if you're to despaired, please get checked out and Doctor Kang we have about 30 seconds left."
163,czlICtpYvAU.mp4,"What kind of on that theme for those people who just are feeling maybe it's not even overwhelming anxiety, but just just nervous about getting into any kind of routine at all your word to them."
164,czlICtpYvAU.mp4,I would agree with dr. Unger.
165,czlICtpYvAU.mp4,I think that there is this concept of pandemic fatigue like a precursor to mental health symptoms are characterized by sleep disturbance irritability anxiety of feeling of loneliness.
166,czlICtpYvAU.mp4,Be careful Be watchful for those and basic self-care routine regular sleep routine regular movement exercise and social connection.
167,czlICtpYvAU.mp4,It's not socializing but social bonding be very aware.
168,czlICtpYvAU.mp4,We need to flatten the mental health curve in really help Canadians get through this difficult time.
169,czlICtpYvAU.mp4,And I don't say this.
170,czlICtpYvAU.mp4,Glibly it actually is comforting hearing from both of you and we know the lots of questions we didn't get too.
171,czlICtpYvAU.mp4,So hopefully we can do this again.
172,czlICtpYvAU.mp4,Thank you very much.
173,czlICtpYvAU.mp4,Thank you.
174,czlICtpYvAU.mp4,My pleasure.
175,pBVAnaHxHbM.mp4,We have to put in place an infrastructure not just here at home.
176,pBVAnaHxHbM.mp4,But globally that allows us to see it quickly isolated quickly respond to it so that if and when a new strain of flu like the Spanish Flu crops up Five years from now or a decade from now we've made the investment and we're further along to be able to catch it.
177,pBVAnaHxHbM.mp4,The funding we're asking for is needed to keep strengthening our capacity here at home so we can respond to any future Ebola cases.
178,pBVAnaHxHbM.mp4,It's needed to help us partner with other countries.
179,pBVAnaHxHbM.mp4,Prevent and deal with future outbreaks and threats before they become epidemics.
180,pBVAnaHxHbM.mp4,We were lucky with H1N1.
181,pBVAnaHxHbM.mp4,That it did not prove to be more deadly.
182,pBVAnaHxHbM.mp4,"We can't say we're lucky with ebola because obviously it's having a devastating effect in effect in West Africa, but it is not Airborne in its transmission."
183,pBVAnaHxHbM.mp4,There are met and likely will come a time in which we have both an airborne disease.
184,pBVAnaHxHbM.mp4,That is deadly.
185,pBVAnaHxHbM.mp4,"And in order for us to deal with that effectively, we have to put in place an infrastructure not just here at home."
186,pBVAnaHxHbM.mp4,But globally that allows us to see it quickly isolated quickly respond to a quick so that if and when a new strain of flu like the Spanish Flu crops up Five years from now or a decade from now.
187,pBVAnaHxHbM.mp4,We've made the investment.
188,pBVAnaHxHbM.mp4,And we're further along to be able to catch it.
189,pBVAnaHxHbM.mp4,It is a smart investment for us to make.
190,pBVAnaHxHbM.mp4,It's not just Insurance.
191,pBVAnaHxHbM.mp4,It is knowing that down the road.
192,pBVAnaHxHbM.mp4,We're going to continue to have problems like this particularly in a globalized world.
193,pBVAnaHxHbM.mp4,Where You move from one side of the world to the other.
194,pBVAnaHxHbM.mp4,"In a day, so this is important now but it's also important for our future and our children's future and our grandchildren's future."
195,pBVAnaHxHbM.mp4,I cannot think of a better example of an area where We should all agree then passing this emergency funding to fight Ebola.
196,pBVAnaHxHbM.mp4,And to set up some of the public health infrastructure that we need to deal with potential outbreaks in the future.
197,pBVAnaHxHbM.mp4,You know a lot of people think that goes away in April with the heat as the heat comes in.
198,pBVAnaHxHbM.mp4,Typically that will go away at April this moment.
199,pBVAnaHxHbM.mp4,We think we have it very much in hand.
200,pBVAnaHxHbM.mp4,Dr. Fouch eat said earlier this week that the lag in testing was in fact a failing.
201,pBVAnaHxHbM.mp4,Do you take responsibility for that?
202,pBVAnaHxHbM.mp4,"No, I don't take responsibility at all said that you don't take responsibility."
203,pBVAnaHxHbM.mp4,But you did disband the White House pandemic office and the officials that were working in that office left this Administration abruptly.
204,pBVAnaHxHbM.mp4,So what responsibility do you take to that and the officials that worked in that office said that you that the White House lost valuable time because that office wasn't disbanded.
205,pBVAnaHxHbM.mp4,What do you make of that?
206,pBVAnaHxHbM.mp4,"Well, I just think it's a See question because what we've done is and Tony had said numerous times that we saved thousands of lives because of the quick closing and when you say me I didn't do it."
207,pBVAnaHxHbM.mp4,"We have a group of people I could I could ask perhaps by Administration, but I could perhaps ask Tony about that because I don't know anything about Some of the people we cut they haven't been used for many many years and if they if we have a need and we can get them very quickly and rather than spending the money and I'm a business person."
208,pBVAnaHxHbM.mp4,I don't like having thousands of people around when you don't need it.
209,iv4mrCE6Tgg.mp4,Since December 2019 clinicians around the world have reported their findings on the symptoms of the novel coronavirus initially.
210,iv4mrCE6Tgg.mp4,We thought that fever and dry cough occurred in the majority of patients diagnosed with covid-19 and runny nose.
211,iv4mrCE6Tgg.mp4,And sore throat.
212,iv4mrCE6Tgg.mp4,Where are these findings came from One initial study published in the Lancet in January 2020 that was conducted in 99 patients who are diagnosed andAdmitted to hospitals in Wuhan as the number of covid-19 cases continued to spread throughout the world clinicians were learning more and more about the novel virus.
213,iv4mrCE6Tgg.mp4,"in another study published in February 2020, the China medical treatment expert group for covid-19 reported their findings from 1099 hospitalized patients and outpatients with covid-19 similar to the previous study fever and cough where the two most commonly reported symptoms in mild and severe cases cough occurred in 68 percent of patients on admission only 44% of people in the study presented with Seaver however, once hospitalized 89 percent of patients developed a fever other common symptoms reported were fatigued and mucus production headache muscle and joint pains sore throat and chills occurred in 10 to 20% of patients."
214,iv4mrCE6Tgg.mp4,Other less commonly reported symptoms of covid-19 were nausea or vomiting affecting only five percent of patients and diarrhea occurring in around four percent of patients.
215,iv4mrCE6Tgg.mp4,"Shortness of breath occur at more often in severe cases up until now we only talked about hospitalized patients, but most patients with covid-19 are not admitted to the hospital what are their symptoms in a more recent study published in April 20-21 researchers analyzed data from over 22,000 people living in Iceland to investigate the spread of covid-19."
216,iv4mrCE6Tgg.mp4,They also looked at symptoms in ambulatory patients.
217,iv4mrCE6Tgg.mp4,The participants were recruited from the community and not the hospital among the twenty two thousand participants 9000 199 were deemed at high risk for SARS Cove to infection.
218,iv4mrCE6Tgg.mp4,These included patients who were either symptomatic were returning to Iceland from a high-risk country or had been in contact with someone who was infected with SARS cuff to within this high-risk group of nine thousand one hundred ninety-nine 1221 tested positive for SAR scoff to Affection in the people who tested positive fever occurred in 43 percent of patients and cuff occurred in 28 percent of patients body aches also occurred in about 20% of patients headache was another common symptom reported by covid-19 patients in the community occurring in 21 percent of patients other reported symptoms were fatigued runny nose sore throat and loss of smell or taste comparing the data from hospitalized.
219,iv4mrCE6Tgg.mp4,"Patience and out patients with covid-19 fever occurred at approximately the same rate in both groups of patients, but still less than half of patients presented with fever cough and fatigue seem to be more common in hospitalized patients."
220,iv4mrCE6Tgg.mp4,"Whereas body aches and headaches occurred more frequently in outpatients in a subsequent analyses of the 22,000 patients included in the study 43 percent of participants who tested positive for covid-19."
221,iv4mrCE6Tgg.mp4,Asymptomatic at the time they were tested highlighting the potential spread of Tsar scoff to among asymptomatic people.
222,iv4mrCE6Tgg.mp4,Although they didn't track the participants at a later stage the authors argue that it's likely that some of these patients eventually develop symptoms.
223,iv4mrCE6Tgg.mp4,Reported estimates of asymptomatic cases of covid-19 range from 3 percent to 43 percent.
224,iv4mrCE6Tgg.mp4,This wide range shows that the significance of asymptomatic disease requires deeper investigation.
225,iv4mrCE6Tgg.mp4,That's it for now.

243,Ls6_jWiVnfI.mp4,Because Stars Covey to is a new virus.
244,Ls6_jWiVnfI.mp4,We're still learning how it works and trying to figure out the best ways to treat it at the moment.
245,Ls6_jWiVnfI.mp4,The best treatment for patients with covid-19 is to provide them with supportive care such as cough medicine to ease their cough acetaminophen to reduce their fever and sometimes antibiotics in severe cases patients may receive oxygen support or be put on a ventilator which can do the breathing for them currently a worldwide collaboration.
246,Ls6_jWiVnfI.mp4,One of scientists and doctors is working to find treatment options by exploring existing drugs called the solidarity trial.
247,Ls6_jWiVnfI.mp4,They're working on clinical trials to test for therapies recommended by the World Health Organization.
248,Ls6_jWiVnfI.mp4,These therapies include rammed a severe a drug that was originally developed to treat Ebola chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine a treatment for malaria and arthritis the HIV combination drug ritonavir Le Pen of ear and an anti-inflammatory compound called interferon beta in combination with Birla pain of ear the goal of these studies is to find out if any of these treatments slow the progression of the disease and improve survival.
249,Ls6_jWiVnfI.mp4,These drugs are all promising because they've already been shown to be safe for humans under specific circumstances though.
250,Ls6_jWiVnfI.mp4,"It will take more work to be sure they're safe for use with covid-19 other potential therapies include treating patients with plasma from people who have already recovered from covid-19, which might help boost the levels of helpful antibodies that can fight the virus."
251,Ls6_jWiVnfI.mp4,This work is happening.
252,Ls6_jWiVnfI.mp4,"Around the world and right in our own backyard here in the UC System including UC San Diego health a new clinical trial on rammed a severe is set to go through 2023 but not every patient has access to clinical trials or plasma therapy, which is why finding a vaccine for SARS Covey to will be the key to finally eliminating the virus from our community."
253,yjpxQHrZLpw.mp4,Hi impure Luigi Saco.
254,yjpxQHrZLpw.mp4,I'm a professor of cultural economics at rul and University of Milan and a faculty associate at Brooklyn Burke my client Center at the Harvard University.
255,yjpxQHrZLpw.mp4,I'm being really intrigued to participate in this Workshop because I think that that was probably the first time that you could really have a sense of what is the debate today around these emerging you filled exciting you feel that is info Dynamics.
256,yjpxQHrZLpw.mp4,"And what was really interesting was the interdisciplinary makes us.Discussion not only from the point of view of disciplines, but also from the point of view of geography."
257,yjpxQHrZLpw.mp4,I think that is incredible diversity gave us the possibility to experiment real time.
258,yjpxQHrZLpw.mp4,What were the emerging issues?
259,yjpxQHrZLpw.mp4,What were probably also the solution strategies and I'm sure that is experience will influence substantially my way of thinking over this issue over the next few years.
260,yjpxQHrZLpw.mp4,"I think that it's extremely important especially for this new challenging Visions to have a test like this because what happens today, Is that the spite of all the resources that we have there is not enough diversity in our discussions that that was absolutely crucial step forward."
261,yjpxQHrZLpw.mp4,"Wow, cool."
262,yjpxQHrZLpw.mp4,Thank you.
263,Qa7ixw01OiU.mp4,Dr. Eric has colon and rectal surgeon with HCA Houston health care doctor.
264,Qa7ixw01OiU.mp4,Welcome to the show.
265,Qa7ixw01OiU.mp4,Thank you so much for your time.
266,Qa7ixw01OiU.mp4,"And of course, we don't want to alarm anyone."
267,Qa7ixw01OiU.mp4,We're just trying to educate folks.
268,Qa7ixw01OiU.mp4,The story is changing day by day.
269,Qa7ixw01OiU.mp4,"We typically hear about these respiratory symptoms, but now it seems to be indicating that some people are also experiencing what cramping and diarrhea as well."
270,Qa7ixw01OiU.mp4,Why is that?
271,Qa7ixw01OiU.mp4,"Yes, thanks for having me and good afternoon to you."
272,Qa7ixw01OiU.mp4,So it's interesting.
273,Qa7ixw01OiU.mp4,"You know, why would what would be what would we be talking to a colorectal surgeon about symptoms of this coronavirus and what we're noticing in about a fifth of patients their first presenting symptoms or GI related whether it be typically loose stools or having kind of like irritable bowel type symptoms and interesting thing is these are such common symptoms, you know, having some stomach cramps or you know, a nervous type of stomach and some loose bowel."
274,Qa7ixw01OiU.mp4,"We don't want to alarm everyone because just by being you know situations like this where there's increased stress, you can have some belly symptoms and we don't want you to think you're in any major trouble with this pretty simple."
275,Qa7ixw01OiU.mp4,Okay.
276,Qa7ixw01OiU.mp4,So let's talk about some of these symptoms and because I know typically at a colon and rectal practice you see you see everything right hemorrhoids colorectal cancer ulcerative colitis Crohn's disease diverticulitis if someone out there There is experiencing these symptoms.
277,Qa7ixw01OiU.mp4,Is there anything that they should be doing to take extra steps to protect themselves or is there cause for concern that those symptoms may be an indication of something else?
278,Qa7ixw01OiU.mp4,"Yes, I think that what we want to do is kind of listen to our bodies."
279,Qa7ixw01OiU.mp4,"And what's interesting is that people are very alarmed and we understand that about going to the doctor's office or the hospital or the emergency room and everybody's engaging and safe practices and social distancing, but we do want to make sure that during this pandemic that's happening that they're still Healthcare Providers here for you."
280,Qa7ixw01OiU.mp4,And so if you're having particularly I symptoms in that kind of stomach pains or loose bowel movements bleeding rectal bleeding things like that.
281,Qa7ixw01OiU.mp4,I'm go ahead and talk to your doctor.
282,Qa7ixw01OiU.mp4,Most doctors are doing what's called telemedicine and Telehealth visits.
283,Qa7ixw01OiU.mp4,"In fact, I think pretty much everyone I know is so it's as simple as calling the office and maybe making what you call a virtual appointment."
284,Qa7ixw01OiU.mp4,So I would the first thing is I wouldn't get alarmed but I definitely would talk to your healthcare provider about your symptoms and just make sure that there's nothing more worrisome happening and what doctor what extra steps can patients take to protect themselves if they are suffering from some of these conditions will first and foremost.
285,Qa7ixw01OiU.mp4,"If you're finding that you're having some of the GI symptoms with the studies and there was studies out of China and now we're having some states what they're saying is that number one just engaged in safe practices washing your hands, you know wearing a mask if you're outside because You might be one of those asymptomatic carriers meaning that might have covid-19 virus and you're perfectly feeling great doing well, but you might pass it on to someone else."
286,Qa7ixw01OiU.mp4,So one of the things that you can do is kind of help Foster good care by washing your hands.
287,Qa7ixw01OiU.mp4,"In fact, the most common way that we think people are getting the virus is by hands to the mouth and I think in Houston and in Texas in general, we're seeing a phenomenal job at keeping thing everything."
288,Qa7ixw01OiU.mp4,"Safe, but kid the GI kind of stomach issues are so common that I think just eating healthy like like we typically do try to avoid either constipation or diarrhea by taking a lot of fiber in your diet drinking lots of fluids and eating fruits and vegetables and pretty much staying staying healthiest is advised and you just said it GI issues are very common if people are experiencing some some things that normally they would experience."
289,Qa7ixw01OiU.mp4,I know our schedules for many of us have changed our diet.
290,Qa7ixw01OiU.mp4,May have shifted a bit are there symptoms though?
291,Qa7ixw01OiU.mp4,"Dr. Haas that we should be keeping an eye on that would lead us to either, you know, call our doctor or in more extreme cases visit the emergency room."
292,Qa7ixw01OiU.mp4,I would say that that's a great question because although there's a lot of distractions right now.
293,Qa7ixw01OiU.mp4,"Please take care of your what your body is telling you and some of what we call the warning signs of, you know, some of the things that we deal with which is a little more serious as colon cancer and in fact T' colon cancer is still the number two cause of cancer death in the United States."
294,Qa7ixw01OiU.mp4,"But the good news is that if you catch it early, it's one of the most curable situations and in the colorectal Community."
295,Qa7ixw01OiU.mp4,We're noticing that we don't want something like covid-19 or two prices that's happening.
296,Qa7ixw01OiU.mp4,Take away from your everyday care.
297,Qa7ixw01OiU.mp4,So if you're feeling stomach pains change in your bowel movements weight loss or loss of appetite if you have any bleeding Especially little bit of bleeding from your bottom.
298,Qa7ixw01OiU.mp4,"We definitely advise for you to come in or call we want to make sure we can screen you for colon cancer, which which is something that we want to keep in mind."
299,Qa7ixw01OiU.mp4,You don't want to forget about just the day-to-day things that we do to keep ourselves safe and healthy.
300,Qa7ixw01OiU.mp4,"Well, dr. Eric Haas."
301,Qa7ixw01OiU.mp4,Thank you so much for your time today.
302,Qa7ixw01OiU.mp4,"And of course, I know that HCA Healthcare it is so critical that care is not delayed."
303,Qa7ixw01OiU.mp4,So the message from HCA Houston health.
304,Qa7ixw01OiU.mp4,Care is do not delay your care.

306,Qa7ixw01OiU.mp4,We'll be right back.
307,eSP9J69Ig4E.mp4,"We're something Taemin face, but we have to start preparing the message from Health officials is a mix of reassurance and caution."
308,eSP9J69Ig4E.mp4,We're also starting to prepare for a possible pandemic.
309,eSP9J69Ig4E.mp4,"So we can't we can't do this with our eyes closed and not recognize what might happen weeks and months from now Travelers who visited Hubei Province in China still get extra screening others in airports are asked to speak up if they have any symptoms, but Health officials say simply shuttering Canada to anyone, isn't it?"
310,eSP9J69Ig4E.mp4,Solution it's not about closing.
311,eSP9J69Ig4E.mp4,The borders is surely from a from a public health perspective closing borders has never proven to be effective in terms of stopping the sort of the spread or the introduction of disease into any country officials.
312,eSP9J69Ig4E.mp4,Say the Health Care system is preparing to including lessons learned from past outbreaks right now.
313,eSP9J69Ig4E.mp4,We doing 30 or 40 tests a day our lab can do up to a thousand but we don't want to rest in that.
314,eSP9J69Ig4E.mp4,When do we have to go to two or three thousand having to prepare for that?
315,eSP9J69Ig4E.mp4,"So you go to do that preparation now even the Armed Forces Horses, which has helped with repatriation flights and quarantines says it's ready to do more."
316,eSP9J69Ig4E.mp4,We are currently refreshing contingency plans for a larger domestic response.
317,eSP9J69Ig4E.mp4,I think it's always wise to be prepared from a community and a country level the health Minister said today Canadians can play a role as well by washing their hands staying home if they're ill and being ready the same way.
318,eSP9J69Ig4E.mp4,They would for a major snowstorm or power disruption.
319,eSP9J69Ig4E.mp4,There's no magic to this.
320,eSP9J69Ig4E.mp4,It's really about first of all making sure that you do have enough.
321,eSP9J69Ig4E.mp4,"Flies if someone in your family becomes ill if you yourself become ill that you have what you need to survive, you know for a week or so without having without going out."
322,eSP9J69Ig4E.mp4,"The goal is to reassure officials insist Canadians risk of getting covid-19 is low and that they are ready to respond if that changes Catherine: CBC News, Ottawa"

330,cEbZszl7b4U.mp4,She says her skills came in handy during the onset of the coronavirus pandemic in the spring even at that time.
331,cEbZszl7b4U.mp4,None of us could have foreseen that the entire country would be on a lockdown for close to two months and I realized that even as well prepared as my family.
332,cEbZszl7b4U.mp4,Are you Don't think it can happen to us.
333,cEbZszl7b4U.mp4,Bedford says one of the most important lessons from the supply shortages earlier this year is to think Beyond paper products and cleaning supplies pay attention to what your family uses regularly and don't wait to make sure you have those things on hand in the event of a second wave.
334,cEbZszl7b4U.mp4,I realize just a few days ago that on my family uses coconut oil a lot.
335,cEbZszl7b4U.mp4,I never actually stock up on it and I realized that is something we actually would really miss and today about a big bucket whether it's a need or a want.
336,cEbZszl7b4U.mp4,Want those are the things that you should start looking for and stocking up on doctors say now is also a good time to schedule any medical appointments.
337,cEbZszl7b4U.mp4,You may have put off during lockdown keep an extra two to four weeks supply of your medications on hand and restock.
338,cEbZszl7b4U.mp4,Your first aid kids Tylenol the great a pain reliever Advil or Motrin is an anti-inflammatory medication.
339,cEbZszl7b4U.mp4,That's great to have on hand and so would also make sure just to have any first aid equipment Band-Aids antiseptic that They need just in case their shortages on those as well and well stores focus on Stocking Necessities over seasonal items Bedford says to plan now for upcoming holidays and special occasions.
340,cEbZszl7b4U.mp4,So you can give your family a sense of normalcy even during a pandemic our children.
341,cEbZszl7b4U.mp4,They need continuity.
342,cEbZszl7b4U.mp4,They need tradition that really the comfort of family traditions.
343,cEbZszl7b4U.mp4,So looking ahead start thinking what birthdays are coming up in the next four five six months.
344,cEbZszl7b4U.mp4,"And as for where to store those new Necessities the survival mom says as tough as it is now is the time to declutter your home to clear out the stuff that you don't need to make sure you have room for the stuff that you do, but it's great advice."

419,84vGICi0Gt0.mp4,I made a video about what a pandemic would be like in the present.
420,84vGICi0Gt0.mp4,This was based on the fictional outbreak from the game The Last of Us and what we're experiencing now is very much real if you go to health map dot-org you can see a time-lapse of how covid-19 spread and just how How quickly it did for an even more in-depth look the system science and engineering department at John Hopkins University created an interactive map of the world where you can go country by country and see the number of cases in the bottom right is a chart that represents the exponential growth of covid-19.
421,84vGICi0Gt0.mp4,And if you've ever been curious about what exponential growth means and how it relates to pandemics.
422,84vGICi0Gt0.mp4,"Well, I cannot recommend highly enough three blue one Brown's video on the topic."
423,84vGICi0Gt0.mp4,"It is incredibly informative and a wonderful Insight on what is currently happening, but with everyone staying at home right now."
424,84vGICi0Gt0.mp4,I thought it would be good to bring back a show that we haven't done in years one where we go and explore the internet together and hopefully show you some websites that you can spend some time with so sit back relax and let me show you some dongs.
425,84vGICi0Gt0.mp4,Things that you can do online now guys.

430,84vGICi0Gt0.mp4,This site is amazing.
431,84vGICi0Gt0.mp4,"It is a wonderful place to get lost in there is so much to explore for example, why not Venture into the Bob Ross arts and crafts center there."
432,84vGICi0Gt0.mp4,You can make some 8-bit.
433,84vGICi0Gt0.mp4,Or watch every single episode of The Joy of Painting or why not go into one of the art galleries.
434,84vGICi0Gt0.mp4,"Let's try gallery 3, they have an entire section of old radio broadcasts and live radio."
435,84vGICi0Gt0.mp4,"I'd highly recommend checking gallery for that is image collections from the Met and the Art Institute of Chicago Wolfman museum is part point-and-click Adventure part exploratory Paradise, but instead of just looking at other peoples art create your own with people all over the world on Mal Mal dot IO here you can see what other users across the globe of drawn join in and draw with them or you can create your own."

437,84vGICi0Gt0.mp4,No that is Art.
438,84vGICi0Gt0.mp4,I wonder how much would sell for at auction to get a sense for that play the auction game.
439,84vGICi0Gt0.mp4,It shows you an image of a piece of art that was sold and you guess how much it was sold for let's see.
440,84vGICi0Gt0.mp4,I'm gonna guess 1 million dollars and I was incredibly wrong.
441,84vGICi0Gt0.mp4,"Okay, I'm feeling good about this one 500,000."
442,84vGICi0Gt0.mp4,Okay.
443,84vGICi0Gt0.mp4,"Well, I obviously have no understanding of the art world."
444,84vGICi0Gt0.mp4,So I'm going to switch creative careers and try my hand at soundscape that world if you want to zone out or have some pleasant ambient music playing in the background.
445,84vGICi0Gt0.mp4,You can create your own click on the soundscape you want to start with and then choose your Rhythm Harmony bass Melody and Extras until you create something like this.
446,84vGICi0Gt0.mp4,And keep that new tune playing in the background while we explore the Rockets of Earth.
447,84vGICi0Gt0.mp4,You can Browse by lift class country manufacturer active Rockets reusable rockets and Rockets rated for human travel.
448,84vGICi0Gt0.mp4,"Once you find what you're looking for, you can find out details like its maximum lift capacity to different orbits how much the rocket costs its launch history and photos of said rocket."
449,84vGICi0Gt0.mp4,There is also a really cool compare feature to see how two different rocket stack up next to each other.
450,84vGICi0Gt0.mp4,"Now, if you're really bored why not learn a useful skill like speaking backwards with this phonetic."
451,84vGICi0Gt0.mp4,"Sir type in what you want to say reverse it and do occur at but yeah, I always you know, it's I'm Gonna Leave You with two more things."
452,84vGICi0Gt0.mp4,The first is that if you want to know more about covid-19 how to protect yourself how it got started what the implications are around it.
453,84vGICi0Gt0.mp4,"Well, then you should watch these two videos one is by in a nutshell in the other is by Mark Rober."
454,84vGICi0Gt0.mp4,I'll link to them down in the description.
455,84vGICi0Gt0.mp4,They really are fantastic.
456,84vGICi0Gt0.mp4,They do a much better job than I could of explaining the situation.
457,84vGICi0Gt0.mp4,And then the last thing is dongs are all about doing things online.
458,84vGICi0Gt0.mp4,"Now, what about doing things in real life?"
459,84vGICi0Gt0.mp4,Well for that we have the Curiosity Box by Vsauce Michael Cantor and I and the whole Vsauce team.
460,84vGICi0Gt0.mp4,"It's a quarterly stems subscription box filled with books and t-shirts and video games and physics toys and puzzles and experiments and is something that we're very passionate about we spend a lot of time working on this and it's not only a great way to support Vsauce outside of watching our videos, but it's a great way to support your brain and the brains of others."
461,84vGICi0Gt0.mp4,A portion of the proceeds from every sale of the Box goes to alzheimer's research.
462,84vGICi0Gt0.mp4,I think actually by the end of this year.
463,84vGICi0Gt0.mp4,"We should be close to two hundred thousand dollars in donations, which is fantastic."
464,84vGICi0Gt0.mp4,So if you want to join the Curiosity Community its curiosity box.com check it out.
465,84vGICi0Gt0.mp4,I hope you really love it.
466,84vGICi0Gt0.mp4,We love it a lot.
467,84vGICi0Gt0.mp4,"Oh, I don't want to spoil too much."
468,84vGICi0Gt0.mp4,But I do want to show you one product which is the caliber on 12.
469,84vGICi0Gt0.mp4,Now.
470,84vGICi0Gt0.mp4,This is a puzzle that Michael himself has said I'm being totally serious.
471,84vGICi0Gt0.mp4,It is the only puzzle that I own.
472,84vGICi0Gt0.mp4,That I have yet to solve.
473,84vGICi0Gt0.mp4,It really is tough.
474,84vGICi0Gt0.mp4,I've had a lot of trouble with this guy but was made by Thomas Edison son Theodore Edison in 1933.
475,84vGICi0Gt0.mp4,There was only a couple hundred mate.
476,84vGICi0Gt0.mp4,We found the original patent and we remade it doing all the measurements everything even the same material.
477,84vGICi0Gt0.mp4,The pieces are made of Bakelite just like they were back in the day.
478,84vGICi0Gt0.mp4,So that is one of the products in this box.
479,84vGICi0Gt0.mp4,I hope you love it because I love you and as always Thanks for watching.
480,ywfDfNnHCqI.mp4,There's a lot of questions for the good doctor here and let's get to the next one are people with diabetes high risk for covid-19.
481,ywfDfNnHCqI.mp4,Yes.
482,ywfDfNnHCqI.mp4,Diabetes is a high risk factor for many diseases and certainly covid-19 is one of them.
483,ywfDfNnHCqI.mp4,What would you say are the highest risk factors?
484,ywfDfNnHCqI.mp4,Asthma you mentioned diabetes.
485,ywfDfNnHCqI.mp4,"What would be some other pre-existing 's so pre-existing lung disease of any kind including asthma and many folks have COPD, which is chronic Obstructive pulmonary disease hypertension diabetes any type of heart disease and of course increasing age and age frankly is associated with increasing illnesses."
486,ywfDfNnHCqI.mp4,And that's part of the reason that older people are much more susceptible.
487,ywfDfNnHCqI.mp4,"Okay, next text coming in is it true that people with the type O blood have a higher resistance to covid-19."
488,ywfDfNnHCqI.mp4,There's no evidence that that's true to my knowledge.
489,ywfDfNnHCqI.mp4,"There's been a lot of internet traffic around blood types, but there's no scientific evidence to my knowledge that blood types are a factor."
490,ywfDfNnHCqI.mp4,You mention one thing.
491,ywfDfNnHCqI.mp4,I want to play off of the you mentioned internet traffic.
492,ywfDfNnHCqI.mp4,There's a lot of theories floating around about this and that how does that is that how harmful is that?
493,ywfDfNnHCqI.mp4,"Well, it can be it can be minimal or it can be seriously harmful, you know, the whole controversy around chloroquine as a treatment for this disease."
494,ywfDfNnHCqI.mp4,We still don't know how effective that is.
495,ywfDfNnHCqI.mp4,"But you know many people took that and ran with it and look for chloroquine type compounds in household substances, and there were overdoses and you know, lots of problems associated with that."
496,ywfDfNnHCqI.mp4,So home remedies typically are not useful.
497,ywfDfNnHCqI.mp4,You know many of these theories are unproven and I think it's a situation where we don't know everything about this virus which allows people to conjecture a lot.
498,ywfDfNnHCqI.mp4,"Yeah, that's true."
499,ywfDfNnHCqI.mp4,I guess when there's a lot of unknown people will grab onto things because there's nothing to say that's been completely disproven.
500,ywfDfNnHCqI.mp4,"All right, let's get to the next one doc."
501,ywfDfNnHCqI.mp4,If you get coronavirus you get over it.
502,ywfDfNnHCqI.mp4,Is that it can you get it again?
503,ywfDfNnHCqI.mp4,So we don't think so.
504,ywfDfNnHCqI.mp4,"What happens is you Antibodies antibodies which are the body's mechanism for killing the virus and we are beginning now to test for antibodies, which is a more certain tests that you know, you're cured of the virus."
505,ywfDfNnHCqI.mp4,"So in the in the immediate term, no the answer is no once you have gotten over the disease, you have the antibodies the virus can't come back but viruses mutate and in the future, we may see changes in this particular virus and and the antibodies we have may not be sufficient for a mutated new virus."
506,ywfDfNnHCqI.mp4,"Okay, and your and your antibodies go away or diminish over time."
507,ywfDfNnHCqI.mp4,"So if you have it now, you know two years from now, you may not still have all that immunity."
508,ywfDfNnHCqI.mp4,All right quick text.
509,ywfDfNnHCqI.mp4,We're about out of time doc.
510,ywfDfNnHCqI.mp4,How is everybody doing with dignity?
511,ywfDfNnHCqI.mp4,The doctors nurses in Sacramento has its really hit yet or is everybody managing?
512,ywfDfNnHCqI.mp4,We're managing.
513,ywfDfNnHCqI.mp4,We began preparing months ago.
514,ywfDfNnHCqI.mp4,"We have disaster plans and all our hospitals and for our division, of course people are afraid but we have plenty of protective equipment."
515,ywfDfNnHCqI.mp4,"Now, we have testing improved testing capability."
516,ywfDfNnHCqI.mp4,I think people feel safe and feel prepared.
517,ywfDfNnHCqI.mp4,And those are the two most important aspects of feeling good about being able to manage through this disease safe and prepared to good words for dignity and hopefully all of the Health Systems around here
518,RzW9UUmImVA.mp4,"Transmission of SARS Covey to occurs via droplet transmission contact transmission and aerosol transmission droplet transmission occurs, when respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes are inhaled by a person nearby contact transmission occurs, when a person touches a contaminated surface and then their mouth nose or eyes aerosol transmission occurs, when respiratory droplets containing the virus mix into the air and are then inhaled covid-19 is stable for up to 24 hours on cardboard."
519,RzW9UUmImVA.mp4,Board 2 to 3 days on plastic and stainless steel and up to three hours in aerosols which include fog Mist dust air pollutants and smoke therefore.
520,RzW9UUmImVA.mp4,"It is possible to get infected by touching contaminated object or through the air the incubation period is the time between infection and symptom onset for an illness estimates for covid-19 S incubation period vary from 2 to 14 days, but it is generally assumed to be around five days."
521,RzW9UUmImVA.mp4,There is more debate about the latent period which is the time between infection and infectiousness.
522,RzW9UUmImVA.mp4,It is now thought that people can be infectious before showing symptoms.
523,RzW9UUmImVA.mp4,"And so the latent period is shorter than the incubation period an important case occurs when a traveler is infected in one area and is reported as sick in another area local transmission occurs, if that traveler infects others, or if there is a cluster of cases locally and the spread is easily traced Community transmission occurs when there is no clear source of Infection in fact tivity can be measured using are not are not is important epidemiology."
524,RzW9UUmImVA.mp4,Jargon short for reproduction number.
525,RzW9UUmImVA.mp4,"It is the number of cases on average that an infected person will cause during their infectious period so if are not equals 2, then an infected person will infect an average of two other people while they are infectious."
526,RzW9UUmImVA.mp4,There are two important variants of the are not the basic reproduction number represents the maximum potential of a pathogen to infect people basically what would happen if An infectious person entered a community with no prior immunity the effective reproduction number describes the current vulnerability of a population based on whether people have immunity thanks to vaccination or prior exposure.
527,RzW9UUmImVA.mp4,The effective are not decreases over the course of an outbreak note that both basic and effective reproduction number depend on factors such as environment and demographics in addition to the pathogens infectiousness.
528,RzW9UUmImVA.mp4,The goal of Public Health interventions is to bring are not down to less than 1 as this would cause the disease to die out over time.
529,RzW9UUmImVA.mp4,The seasonal flu has an are not ranging from 0.92 2.1.
530,RzW9UUmImVA.mp4,There was a lot of debate about the are not of covid-19 with estimates from more recent data ranging from 2.7 to 4.2.
531,RzW9UUmImVA.mp4,The variants in these estimates is largely due to differing model assumptions and a lack of data for example models which assumed the possibility of being infectious before symptom onset have estimates that are around 0.5 hire.
532,RzW9UUmImVA.mp4,These are not estimates mean there is much greater.
533,RzW9UUmImVA.mp4,Her potential for spread of covid-19 than for the flu how much greater for the purpose of this example.
534,RzW9UUmImVA.mp4,Let's say that the flu has an R naught of 1.5 and covid-19 has an R naught of three after three cycles of infection 11 people have had the flu and 40 people have been infected with covid-19.
535,RzW9UUmImVA.mp4,"But after 10 cycles of infection, this becomes a hundred seventy-one people with the flu and over 88,000 people with covid-19."
536,ael_7z9eYqc.mp4,"Some of the major developments we are tracking deaths around the world due to confirmed cases of coronavirus hit a new high soaring above 700 thousand for the first time now more than 18 and a half million people are known to be infected as more than 11 million recover and with me here leading things off as always ABC chief medical correspondent, dr. Jennifer Ashton, and dr. Jenn."
537,ael_7z9eYqc.mp4,"We know that hospital icus in Georgia, Alabama, Florida all reporting that they are at near capacity rate."
538,ael_7z9eYqc.mp4,Brings into question the treatment options that are now available for people who have severe cases of covid-19.
539,ael_7z9eYqc.mp4,"Yeah, and that is such a concern Amy."
540,ael_7z9eYqc.mp4,The good news is that the majority of cases of covid-19 can be managed at home.
541,ael_7z9eYqc.mp4,"But when you talk about severe cases requiring hospitalization ICU management, lots of medications being studied right now, we divide them up into those that are showing promising evidence thus far REM Des aveer that anti Ebola drug and IV form granted emergency use authorization by the Yay, people are familiar with that dexamethasone the steroid it is available in every hospital basically in the world."
542,ael_7z9eYqc.mp4,It's cheap.
543,ael_7z9eYqc.mp4,We've had it for a long time also showing some promise in clinical trials are those are the drugs that have promising evidence.
544,ael_7z9eYqc.mp4,There are others that have fallen to a gray Zone exactly.
545,ael_7z9eYqc.mp4,And those are being considered at this point showing mixed evidence.
546,ael_7z9eYqc.mp4,So as we break them down one of them is called didd 2801.
547,ael_7z9eYqc.mp4,It doesn't exactly roll off the tongue.
548,ael_7z9eYqc.mp4,That's an oral pill.
549,ael_7z9eYqc.mp4,Will antiviral medication that shown some promise in human cells and in animal studies immune therapy things like convalescent plasma and monoclonal antibodies.
550,ael_7z9eYqc.mp4,There are these cytokine Inhibitors that really kind of work to dampen that major inflammatory response.
551,ael_7z9eYqc.mp4,One of them is called Tosi and then blood thinners.
552,ael_7z9eYqc.mp4,So all of these at this point showing what we are referring to as mixed evidence in terms of being effective.
553,ael_7z9eYqc.mp4,"All right, and then there are the treatment options that right now have not shown that they do."
554,ael_7z9eYqc.mp4,I'm benefit than harm.
555,ael_7z9eYqc.mp4,"Right and the two big ones I think in that category right now hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine and there's AIDS drugs lipanovich here and ritonavir also not really showing promising results in clinical trials, but I want to be clear as we learn more all of this may change is being aggressively studied not just here in the US but worldwide."
556,ael_7z9eYqc.mp4,All right.
557,ael_7z9eYqc.mp4,Thank you so much.

564,499bYzpQk6E.mp4,My daughter Jessica is a hospitalist in a posterior hospital and she is at work hard day after day the week.
565,499bYzpQk6E.mp4,"She returns home to her to her two children a 10 year old and a three year old and her husband and I watched Jessica cope with both kinds of stress in her life the stress of the care itself worrying about her patients worrying about exposures watching a very very bad disease play out and play out in equitably by the way, almost all Jessica's patients in the covid epidemic are black and brown."
566,499bYzpQk6E.mp4,Although that's not true of the demography of the place.
567,499bYzpQk6E.mp4,She works.
568,499bYzpQk6E.mp4,So she sees it up close and I hear about it every day with anguish in her voice and on her face and then she comes home home to a stressed family a wonderful family everyone trying to cope but pre-adolescent is isolated in his house a three-year-old who misses her mom husband has been dealing with his work and childcare and the threat of covid thing and she did send to the house.
569,499bYzpQk6E.mp4,"Old it's ever present in her life and she's doing okay, but she she'd be the first to say that this is not easy and look at the the lucky circumstance."
570,499bYzpQk6E.mp4,"She's in with her her condition her wealth her her social systems her connectivity neighborhood cheese, and she has a lot of advantages and still feels the stress."
571,499bYzpQk6E.mp4,Imagine what's going on with arrested with the healthcare Workforce membership.
572,499bYzpQk6E.mp4,"That's not like that the what about the nurses aides and the house keep house keepers of the hospital that she absolutely depends on and with who have less resilient in their bank accounts and their social conditions that she's lucky to have we've got to attend to this and yes, I loved seeing the clapping and the streets if I moved to tears when I watch the windows open and Milan or New York celebrating this Workforce but you know clapping is a lot easier than fixing the social conditions that are creating and aggravating the stresses of so many people who work in health care not to mention, of course the populations they serve I guess I'm I don't want to sound like a grouch but when we clap we need to mean it which means structural changes deep changes in the social conditions in our country and other countries to support real safety and opportunity."
573,499bYzpQk6E.mp4,e for everyone
574,ZqaPZ3ST1AY.mp4,Covid-19 is one virus within the coronavirus family a collection of hundreds of viruses usually found in animals today.
575,ZqaPZ3ST1AY.mp4,Seven coronavirus is infect humans with three of them considered serious illnesses those being the 2002 severe acute respiratory syndrome also called SARS virus the 2012 Middle East Respiratory Syndrome also called MERS virus and the 2019 SARS COV to better known as the virus that causes covid-19 whileLess serious coronavirus has can cause the common cold these more serious viruses cause symptoms that are so severe that people can't breathe and need to be hospitalized.
576,ZqaPZ3ST1AY.mp4,For most people covid-19 can be treated like any other bad cold rest drinking fluids and taking over-the-counter medication to manage symptoms like fever and congestion work.
577,ZqaPZ3ST1AY.mp4,"Well for the people who develop much more serious symptoms and need to be hospitalized treatment is primarily focused on supporting individuals, whether body fights the infection and to reduce the patient's symptoms patients who have trouble breathing may be given supplemental oxygen if the oxygen Alone is insufficient to help the patient breathe Health Care Providers may choose to put patients on mechanical ventilation such as BiPAP and in some situations."
578,ZqaPZ3ST1AY.mp4,They may need to intubate and oxygenate the patient through conventional ventilators.
579,ZqaPZ3ST1AY.mp4,There are evolving guidelines from the National Institute of Health on how to treat covid-19 an individual's treatment heavily depends on their health condition and the resources available to the healthcare team.
580,ZqaPZ3ST1AY.mp4,REM does severe is an antiviral medication which disrupts the virus's ability to replicate and spread within the body.
581,ZqaPZ3ST1AY.mp4,"REM does severe specifically is recommended for patients who have been hospitalized and require oxygen, but are not on mechanical ventilation."
582,ZqaPZ3ST1AY.mp4,"Globally, REM Des aveer is in short supply and many Health institutions have very limited quantities of it."
583,ZqaPZ3ST1AY.mp4,Dexamethasone is a corticosteroid a drug that makes adjustments to how the immune system regulates itself dexamethasone or other glucocorticoids similar to it can be used in patients who need oxygen and can be used on patients who are on mechanical ventilation or not on mechanical ventilation.
584,ZqaPZ3ST1AY.mp4,However patients who do not need oxygen are not recommended to take dexamethasone as the side effects of the drug May worsen their condition.
585,ZqaPZ3ST1AY.mp4,"There have been a number of proposed Treatment Solutions you might have heard about in the news to such as the use of injecting the blood plasma of people who have recovered from covid-19 also called convalescent plasma into patients who are seriously ill with the disease in September 2020, the National Institute of Health issued a statement that even with initial trials there hasn't been enough evidence to show this treatment plan helps or harms patients and they do not recommend using this treatment as part of routine treatment plans for the time being."
586,ZqaPZ3ST1AY.mp4,In the spring of 2020 there was a lot of news coverage regarding the use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine to treat severe covid-19 patients in August of 2020 the National Institute of Health issued a statement that recommended against using these drugs as initial trials and covid-19 patients had either shown no benefit at all or had led to worse outcomes for patients due to the drugs inherently dangerous side effects.
587,ZqaPZ3ST1AY.mp4,As a quick recap covid-19 is a virus that produces symptoms similar to the common cold.
588,ZqaPZ3ST1AY.mp4,However in some individuals symptoms can be so severe they are life-threatening for mild and moderate symptoms patients can be treated with rest and over-the-counter medications for severe symptoms patients may need supplemental oxygen or mechanical ventilation guidelines for treatments are constantly evolving and some treatments like rum desert fear and dexamethasone may be beneficial in some patients.
589,ZqaPZ3ST1AY.mp4,Other treatments like chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are not recommended as they have no clear benefits or may potentially harm patients.
590,nTpdlwa9rLE.mp4,I just got tested for the Coronavirus.
591,nTpdlwa9rLE.mp4,And I'm freaking out because the doctors are sending me to the emergency room because my white blood cell count.
592,nTpdlwa9rLE.mp4,So I travel almost full time.
593,nTpdlwa9rLE.mp4,I travel like 80% of the year as a travel journalists and bloggers and I go all over the world.
594,nTpdlwa9rLE.mp4,And so I'm rarely home except for now.
595,nTpdlwa9rLE.mp4,"My first symptom was I started to have a weird feeling kind of felt like a wave running through my body where I felt like I was short circuiting After that, I started to lose my sense of taste and smell completely."
596,nTpdlwa9rLE.mp4,I couldn't taste anything.
597,nTpdlwa9rLE.mp4,"I couldn't smell anything and I started to develop a quick little fever that was only 99 degrees for about an hour and then I started to get the Hallmark symptoms which are the dry cough and the headaches throughout the day, but it just kept getting stronger and stronger and I was coughing all throughout the day one of the scariest things was when the doctor actually Only tested me for covid-19 and I was tested on a Friday morning and at 6 p.m."
598,nTpdlwa9rLE.mp4,The following Monday.
599,nTpdlwa9rLE.mp4,I got a voicemail from my doctor saying Valerie.
600,nTpdlwa9rLE.mp4,This is very important.
601,nTpdlwa9rLE.mp4,You need to call me back immediately and I called him back and I before he even said anything I said I have it don't I he said yes you do and I broke down crying and it was really hard because I kept asking him questions.
602,nTpdlwa9rLE.mp4,And he just didn't have the answers because it is a new virus.
603,nTpdlwa9rLE.mp4,So from start to finish from the beginning of my symptoms to being symptom-free and released from the health department with 16 days.
604,nTpdlwa9rLE.mp4,I'm sharing my story because I think it's important for those who are struggling with the fear of covid-19 or actually have a positive test for covid-19.
605,nTpdlwa9rLE.mp4,"I think it's important for them to see that somebody else has gotten better, but it's also important for Millennials to And that you can become sick with the virus and it is dangerous."
606,nTpdlwa9rLE.mp4,I'm looking forward to a hug.
607,nTpdlwa9rLE.mp4,I'm gonna like cry.
608,nTpdlwa9rLE.mp4,I haven't had any human interaction outside of the doctor swabbing my throat in quite a while.
609,tPJ_ycE7m1s.mp4,The by ambulance is very keen on using the latest Innovation and latest technology in treating and transporting the patients today.
610,tPJ_ycE7m1s.mp4,"We have the isolation shuttle, which is used to isolate and transfer the patient with suspected any suspected transmissible disease the shuttle will isolate the patient and the ambulance compartment and will avoid any further contact with the medics.With a feature of negative pressure to keep the infection diseases inside the capsule search will not transfer to the parameters and it will protect the paramedics safe and it will also transport the patient to the hospital safely."
611,tPJ_ycE7m1s.mp4,It consists of ten Power Ten ports six of them to handle the patient one forgiving ventilation and one for keeping all the vital signs monitor during Transportation.
612,tPJ_ycE7m1s.mp4,One point to give the medicine and one part is is as a westburn.
613,Qiyd3HXX240.mp4,"Hi, my name is Brielle Smith."
614,Qiyd3HXX240.mp4,I'm a second year medical student at MUSC and a leader of the community vulnerability project.
615,Qiyd3HXX240.mp4,Today's topic is the MUSC covid-19 epidemiology intelligence project.
616,Qiyd3HXX240.mp4,I'm joined by.
617,Qiyd3HXX240.mp4,Dr. Michael Sweat The Faculty director of the MUSC Center for Global Health after sweat.
618,Qiyd3HXX240.mp4,Thank you for joining me.
619,Qiyd3HXX240.mp4,At my pleasure.
620,Qiyd3HXX240.mp4,Thank you for having me.
621,Qiyd3HXX240.mp4,My first question is what is the MUSC covid-19 epidemiology intelligence project?
622,Qiyd3HXX240.mp4,"Yeah, the project is really set up to do three main things one is to do ongoing analysis and interpretation of the status of the epidemic in terms of key indicators secondly to provide an easy to work with dashboard that's color coded that gives guidance to policy makers and leaders in terms of sort of starting and stopping mitigation efforts."
623,Qiyd3HXX240.mp4,"And thirdly we have summary of mathematical modeling results both the Institute for health metrics and evaluation the I hme model, which is a model that's been sort of used nationally and it has South Carolina focus on that."
624,Qiyd3HXX240.mp4,And also we have our own internal mathematical model to examine the impact potential impact on the hospital operations.
625,Qiyd3HXX240.mp4,And what are the goals of this project?
626,Qiyd3HXX240.mp4,"Yeah, I think they're kind of two main goals one is to provide regular updates and information to people on the covid epidemic and that's including everything from the broad population in town."
627,Qiyd3HXX240.mp4,"We have a lot of people who regularly check the website but also Business Leaders policy leaders Emperor and in particular MUSC leadership and and how that could affect our own operations and secondly, I think to provide a concise Interpretation for policymakers in terms of making decisions as I mentioned a minute ago related to mitigation efforts, like sort of wind to reduce them or wind to reinstitute them."
628,Qiyd3HXX240.mp4,We may be facing what are some of the key indicators that are being assessed by this project.
629,Qiyd3HXX240.mp4,Right?
630,Qiyd3HXX240.mp4,We've have we have quite a few of them.
631,Qiyd3HXX240.mp4,We particularly look at the growth rate in the number of new cases that are identified and we do seven-day averages on that and compare them over time.
632,Qiyd3HXX240.mp4,So we do Trend analysis and those are very important indicators for where the Epidemics going we also look at things like population prevalence of reported cases.
633,Qiyd3HXX240.mp4,We have markers there for the availability of testing and how quickly the testing or getting reported back.
634,Qiyd3HXX240.mp4,We also have capacity of the hospital to care for patients and the number of beds and ventilators and PPE and those kind of things.
635,Qiyd3HXX240.mp4,We also track measures of social distancing and Mobility which are very interesting.
636,Qiyd3HXX240.mp4,"We keep track of particular outbreak and super spreader events that are reported and we also now are integrating measures on contact tracing and the availability of contact tracing what is an example of how these results from your project have affected the operations of MUSC Health, you know back in March relieve which really wasn't that long ago."
637,Qiyd3HXX240.mp4,We were very uncertain where things were going and we work very closely with the hospital system in terms of making those sorts of estimations that I talked about.
638,Qiyd3HXX240.mp4,So we developed a variety of scenarios sort of a one-step was He sort of severe epidemic that would happen quickly and also severe epidemic that what happened over a much longer period of time and then and then also just the opposite of that sort of less severe quick less severe over a long period of time and we use those scenarios to help the hospital system.
639,Qiyd3HXX240.mp4,Do things like prepare for the number of beds.
640,Qiyd3HXX240.mp4,They might need to make sure the supplies and PPE.
641,Qiyd3HXX240.mp4,We're going to be adequate this project Focus only on the Charleston area or are there other parts of South Carolina being modeled as well?
642,Qiyd3HXX240.mp4,Yeah.
643,Qiyd3HXX240.mp4,"Yeah, we started with just Charleston but you know MUSC has a presence in three main areas of the state here in Charleston, but also in the Florence area there to hospitals up in the Florence area."
644,Qiyd3HXX240.mp4,And then also in the Lancaster area there to hospitals up there too.
645,Qiyd3HXX240.mp4,So we added both Florence and Lancaster as well.
646,Qiyd3HXX240.mp4,So all three of those are examined and we have all them indicators in the modeling results for all three places and these results.
647,Qiyd3HXX240.mp4,Are they available online where people can access it and if How can they get this data?
648,Qiyd3HXX240.mp4,"Yeah, they are online."
649,Qiyd3HXX240.mp4,We have a website.
650,Qiyd3HXX240.mp4,We update that website with the results a weekly on Wednesdays.
651,Qiyd3HXX240.mp4,We that reflects the past week from the Tuesday before that Wednesday.
652,Qiyd3HXX240.mp4,Think it's very easy.
653,Qiyd3HXX240.mp4,If they just do a web search for the MUSC covid-19 epidemiology project.
654,Qiyd3HXX240.mp4,It'll pop right up so much for your insight into this project doctor sweat pleasure.
655,Qiyd3HXX240.mp4,Thanks a lot for having me on today.
656,Qiyd3HXX240.mp4,Appreciate it and thank you for joining.
657,Qiyd3HXX240.mp4,Joining us for this segment of nuse covid-19 community outreach and resource awareness.
658,h1kDzqpDlY0.mp4,"Hi, everybody."
659,h1kDzqpDlY0.mp4,Dr. Mikey.
660,h1kDzqpDlY0.mp4,You've probably heard that some people with covid-19 lose their sense of smell.
661,h1kDzqpDlY0.mp4,We turn this loss of smell a nausea and interestingly.
662,h1kDzqpDlY0.mp4,It's a relatively common symptom of covid-19 up to 55 percent of people who get covid-19 experience a Nas Mia now luckily its term transient which means the sense of smell should return most people return that sense of smell within a couple of weeks.
663,h1kDzqpDlY0.mp4,"However, there's a subset of people around about 10% who still haven't regain that sense of smell within a month."
664,h1kDzqpDlY0.mp4,And now how does this happen?
665,h1kDzqpDlY0.mp4,And why does this happen?
666,h1kDzqpDlY0.mp4,So I've drawn up here the nasal cavity deep within the nose and what you'll find is obviously we Inspire are and as we Inspire are we bring in chemicals and odorants and what happens is Sensory neurons that project from our central nervous system specifically an area called the olfactory bulb.
667,h1kDzqpDlY0.mp4,They project neurons through a bony plate in the nose.
668,h1kDzqpDlY0.mp4,Now if you were to get your finger and stick it up your nose you wouldn't be able to reach Area up the top here which we term the olfactory epithelium the neurons that project through this bony plate can actually be damaged due to a knock and what happens is the Bony plates shears these neurons off.
669,h1kDzqpDlY0.mp4,This isn't what's happening in covid-19.
670,h1kDzqpDlY0.mp4,The neurons that project through will pick up these chemicals known as odorants and sending the signal directly through to the olfactory bulb and then to the central nervous system and brain for us to be aware of what we've smell.
671,h1kDzqpDlY0.mp4,Okay.
672,h1kDzqpDlY0.mp4,Now this olfactory epithelium It isn't just made up of these olfactory neurons or olfactory Sensory neurons.
673,h1kDzqpDlY0.mp4,There's actually a whole bunch of other cells present called supporting cells.
674,h1kDzqpDlY0.mp4,Now this supporting cells can include micro Villi cells Susteren tacular cells globular basal cells olfactory and sheathing cells.
675,h1kDzqpDlY0.mp4,There's a whole bunch of different cells that support the role of the olfactory Sensory neurons.
676,h1kDzqpDlY0.mp4,"Now when I say support what they do is they provide metabolic products, they take away metabolic wastes."
677,h1kDzqpDlY0.mp4,They support the cytoskeletal.
678,h1kDzqpDlY0.mp4,Architecture around the area.
679,h1kDzqpDlY0.mp4,"They also make sure that if any of the cells die, they phagocytosed so they eat them."
680,h1kDzqpDlY0.mp4,They recycle them they make sure that homeostasis is maintained in this micro environment.
681,h1kDzqpDlY0.mp4,So the olfactory neurons can do their job and pick up a sense of smell.
682,h1kDzqpDlY0.mp4,All right.
683,h1kDzqpDlY0.mp4,"Now when we Inspire for example particles that contain the virus szybko V2, we know that the virus is surrounded by proteins called s proteins."
684,h1kDzqpDlY0.mp4,And now what needs to happen is this cells or tissues need to express to particular receptors a stew and TM P RS s to a stew is angiotensin-converting enzyme to and T and P RS S. 2 is a serine protease basically the scissors that chop proteins.
685,h1kDzqpDlY0.mp4,What happens is the virus must bind to a stew receptors and this little serine protease needs to chop some of the proteins on the outside surface of the virus.
686,h1kDzqpDlY0.mp4,That then activates the proteins to be able to embed themselves into the membrane of the cell and it can release its virus or I should say can release its DNA inside the cell itself for replication.
687,h1kDzqpDlY0.mp4,So what scientists have recently done is they've had to look at all the tissues within the body and how to look at the expression of these particular receptors to see what tissues they highly expressed in because that's going to mean likely that they're going to be most susceptible to such as Covey to virus infection.
688,h1kDzqpDlY0.mp4,The found is that the heart has high expression levels the kidneys blood vessels the brain so aspects of the nervous system the respiratory tract and the lungs as well.
689,h1kDzqpDlY0.mp4,This is one of the reasons why we get multi-organ dysfunction in covid-19.
690,h1kDzqpDlY0.mp4,What a most recent paper did in August 20 20 is they had a look at the cells of the olfactory epithelium and they had a look at the expression levels of these two particular receptors what they found was the olfactory Sensory neurons.
691,h1kDzqpDlY0.mp4,Ron's those that pick up the odorants for the sense of smell that aren't really Express those two.
692,h1kDzqpDlY0.mp4,"However, the supporting cells do or at least a subset of those supporting cells to do."
693,h1kDzqpDlY0.mp4,"So, for example, the micro Villi cells."
694,h1kDzqpDlY0.mp4,Thus us tentacular cells in the globular basal cells tend to express a stew and TMP RSS to relatively highly compared to others.
695,h1kDzqpDlY0.mp4,Now what this highlights is that the virus is Covey to tends to infect the supporting cells and damage their ability ability to maintain in homeostasis for the olfactory Sensory neurons there for overtime the olfactory Sensory neurons can't do their job and the sense of smell is lost and it's transient because once the virus has run its course the supporting cells can be regenerated and then can support the olfactory neurons.
696,h1kDzqpDlY0.mp4,I like to think of this as a race car driver.
697,h1kDzqpDlY0.mp4,Now the race car driver seems to do all the work.
698,h1kDzqpDlY0.mp4,The race car driver is the olfactory sensory neurons.
699,h1kDzqpDlY0.mp4,However without its supporting Team without People there to refuel the car to fix the car when it's damaged to tell the driver where to go over a short period of time the cars just going to stop and the drivers going to be non-functional.
700,h1kDzqpDlY0.mp4,But once you replenish a rejuvenate or regenerate that supporting team the drive will be able to start kicking into gear so to speak and be able to do their job.
701,h1kDzqpDlY0.mp4,So this seems to be what's happening when the virus as Kobe to is infecting the olfactory epithelium and people are losing their sense of smell and covid-19.
702,h1kDzqpDlY0.mp4,teen
703,C50nh43Qkso.mp4,There's a chance that covid-19 will make existing in a quaint inequities in health care worse.
704,C50nh43Qkso.mp4,We're talking about lack of health insurance or people who just can't take the proper precautions here to shed.
705,C50nh43Qkso.mp4,Some light on the issue from Hartford Healthcare is Sarah Lewis.
706,C50nh43Qkso.mp4,She's the vice president of Health Equity for our viewers.
707,C50nh43Qkso.mp4,Nice to have you here.
708,C50nh43Qkso.mp4,"Thank you, sir."
709,C50nh43Qkso.mp4,If you would explain to us how your department has really stepped up in this crisis.
710,C50nh43Qkso.mp4,Sure.
711,C50nh43Qkso.mp4,Thank you so much for having me this afternoon.
712,C50nh43Qkso.mp4,So as we know there are existing inequities and existing Health disparities among populations across the state of Connecticut.
713,C50nh43Qkso.mp4,"And unfortunately, this crisis has the potential to exacerbate some of those."
714,C50nh43Qkso.mp4,So for instance people who are already food insecure or economically insecure are at a risk of going without food for even longer period of time or losing their jobs because they their businesses have been shut down.
715,C50nh43Qkso.mp4,"And as a result, we're looking at all the solutions that we can potentially offer because our Health Care system is more than one that is made up of hospitals and and Physicians offices were also part of a community and we think about the social needs of our patients and their families."
716,C50nh43Qkso.mp4,And so we're figuring out how we can step up and help in those areas that I mentioned sure and sorry history a New Haven band homeless man.
717,C50nh43Qkso.mp4,He tested positive what can happen to that population who really can't do the social distancing.
718,C50nh43Qkso.mp4,Right.
719,C50nh43Qkso.mp4,"So right we're telling everyone stay home stay safe, but for people who are on housed or experiencing homelessness."
720,C50nh43Qkso.mp4,"It's very difficult for them to follow those instructions, even though they want to I think it's important to realize that our expiry our populations experiencing homelessness many of them already have a number of healthcare underlying health conditions that make them more vulnerable to a covid infection."
721,C50nh43Qkso.mp4,So we're working closely with the city of Hartford and the state of Connecticut.
722,C50nh43Qkso.mp4,Other municipalities across the state to understand how we can help them in times when they need to isolate people who have a success pected case of covid-19 help them in their quarantine effort.
723,C50nh43Qkso.mp4,And of course get them the medical care that they need at the time that they need it and provide access to testing and triage as those things become needed.
724,C50nh43Qkso.mp4,So let's talk a little bit about hourly workers.
725,C50nh43Qkso.mp4,They're going to face all new hardships when this virus.
726,C50nh43Qkso.mp4,Continues this could turn into a big mental health problems trying to make ends meet and make ends meet.
727,C50nh43Qkso.mp4,What sort of advice do you have for them?
728,C50nh43Qkso.mp4,"Well, I first and foremost just want to say thank you for all of your diligent work keeping our economy afloat up to this point."
729,C50nh43Qkso.mp4,I know that we have some really hard working.
730,C50nh43Qkso.mp4,People are there who are looking at their bank accounts and and suffering and wondering what's going to come next and I want to suggest that BP be compassionate with yourself and others.
731,C50nh43Qkso.mp4,"And also if you need some help, please come to our website connections that matter dot-org, which is a website that we stood Last year to help people who are in need find resources in their Community you go online again."
732,C50nh43Qkso.mp4,It's connections that matter dot-org all one word.
733,C50nh43Qkso.mp4,"You can put in your zip code and find resources in your community for economic assistance for food assistance housing assistance, a wide variety of organizations have made their services available through that website and just know that we're here for you and we're on the other side when we get through it sure and so are you hearing about any sort of discrimination in the Asian population?"
734,C50nh43Qkso.mp4,Population.
735,C50nh43Qkso.mp4,Mmh.
736,C50nh43Qkso.mp4,"Yes, thank you for bringing that up."
737,C50nh43Qkso.mp4,"Unfortunately in times of Public Health crisis, there's a history in this country and others where we see an elevation of bigotry and racism and unfortunately, this has been no exception and it's it's absolutely unacceptable."
738,C50nh43Qkso.mp4,"And unfortunately, it's happening for people who are within different Asian populations across our state or even are perceived to be of an Asian descent already agent background."
739,C50nh43Qkso.mp4,And it's important that we look out for one another.

749,VQlXOOugWXk.mp4,Consider this the last line of defense against covid-19.
750,VQlXOOugWXk.mp4,The Intensive Care Unit where the most critically ill patients are treated many are put on a ventilator to help them breathe others such as Boris Johnson are given oxygen likely through a mask.
751,VQlXOOugWXk.mp4,So the nurses at the bedside but there's Toronto ICU director points out.
752,VQlXOOugWXk.mp4,There's still no guarantee.
753,VQlXOOugWXk.mp4,Anything will help a lot of patients get worse despite the ventilation and then there's very little that we can do but wait and hope that things turn around the BBC was granted.
754,VQlXOOugWXk.mp4,Access to an ICU treating coronavirus patients in London ready City where medical staff have found turning patients onto their stomach can help oxygen reach their lungs.
755,VQlXOOugWXk.mp4,"It's a delicate procedure, but crucial with covid-19 jeopardizing respiratory functions."
756,VQlXOOugWXk.mp4,"Well, it was a terrible time."
757,VQlXOOugWXk.mp4,Because I'll not breathing some much younger patients have wound up in intensive care as well as a challenge including 41 year old Renee Segura from Barrie Ontario.
758,VQlXOOugWXk.mp4,He's been home for a week still slowly recovering or six to eight weeks.
759,VQlXOOugWXk.mp4,I am going to have a lingering cough but day by day starting to go away.
760,VQlXOOugWXk.mp4,It's not gone that way for everyone is British.
761,VQlXOOugWXk.mp4,ICU doctor says patients put on a ventilator for several days.
762,VQlXOOugWXk.mp4,Days may be in for a long recovery.
763,VQlXOOugWXk.mp4,We shouldn't expect to see them return to their full level of function for several months after the illness.
764,VQlXOOugWXk.mp4,"This is really going to hit people hard early research during this outbreak found half of intensive care patients don't survive, but doctors are getting a better understanding of covid-19."
765,VQlXOOugWXk.mp4,So while there may be no cure for patients.
766,VQlXOOugWXk.mp4,There is more.
767,VQlXOOugWXk.mp4,"Hope Thomas degler CBC News, Toronto."
768,7vN6uS-hB6Q.mp4,Hi everybody.
769,7vN6uS-hB6Q.mp4,My name is Lydia.
770,7vN6uS-hB6Q.mp4,I woke the Mobile Care Unit here at Valley Medical Center today.
771,7vN6uS-hB6Q.mp4,I'm just going to talk about the process of how we tell patients to the drive-thru.
772,7vN6uS-hB6Q.mp4,And this is constant.
773,7vN6uS-hB6Q.mp4,I'm going to talk to how we swap the patient.
774,7vN6uS-hB6Q.mp4,So he's a squab have to go all the way to 3 inches and when the patient's put through the kind of verify their ID for me my daughter bird just to make sure we're swapping the right patient.And we want to make sure the roof window is rolled up until the enemy is ready to swap them.
775,7vN6uS-hB6Q.mp4,And also make sure they have their masks on.
776,7vN6uS-hB6Q.mp4,"I know it's really difficult for patients with asthma who have difficulty in Reading to have their masks on all the time, but we asked us to have it covering their face while we swap them and then they can remove it."
777,7vN6uS-hB6Q.mp4,"So when the patient pulled through you don't have to get out of the car, you just have to be seated and just roll your window down."
778,7vN6uS-hB6Q.mp4,"So once again, he's ready and they're all their window down verify the name and birthday."
779,7vN6uS-hB6Q.mp4,"We even the sheet that has the information on what to do once you get to dessert and if it's positive and then kind of explain them the process before we swap them so it has to be 10 seconds each side, and it's a little bit difficult."
780,7vN6uS-hB6Q.mp4,"Feel like sneezing or coughing you can turn your face away, but just have your mask on and so just have them pull the mass right below her nose covering their mouth and then you have one side for 10 seconds."
781,7vN6uS-hB6Q.mp4,"So thankfully we have Flexible flubs, I would say it's still not a comfortable test to have done but overall it's so much better to have the test if you have symptoms and know whether or not you have covid-19 so you can make good decisions to keep your family and your community safe."
782,7vN6uS-hB6Q.mp4,"And the closest thing I can compare it to all the sensations a little bit different as if you've had dental work done and but initial injection that you get for numbing medication that shot can feel these for me pretty intense and uncomfortable, but it's Over in a few seconds and so for me when I have a test on I felt that initial intense just Comfort."
783,7vN6uS-hB6Q.mp4,"I mean, it's a swab up at the far back of your nose and you have a lot of receptors in your nose for sensation and it was it was uncomfortable and I teared up and I breathe through it, but then it was over great."
784,7vN6uS-hB6Q.mp4,Do you have any tips for when you're getting the test for anything that can kind of help you get through it?
785,7vN6uS-hB6Q.mp4,Try holding the bread because it prevents them from sneezing coughing sobbing.
786,7vN6uS-hB6Q.mp4,So holding their breath was flopping customs and then having their hands on the steering wheels or however they have want to be comfortable but about your city and your steps I would say I was nervous.
787,7vN6uS-hB6Q.mp4,I have a pretty reflexive response to pain and just the prize and so I was worried that I might grab the person's arm who was doing the test and I didn't want to cause them any Armor danger and so I really just prepared myself mentally to stay still and know that it would be temporary.
788,7vN6uS-hB6Q.mp4,But also I held on it helped my hands tight to keep them from having that knee-jerk response.
789,7vN6uS-hB6Q.mp4,"You can also sit on your hands too, or if you're driving you can hold on to the steering wheel to trick your brain into staying still and based on that."
790,7vN6uS-hB6Q.mp4,It's a good idea because sometimes when you pull their hands away the squad Pop and drop and then they have to repeat the procedure of suppose.
791,7vN6uS-hB6Q.mp4,That's again.
792,7vN6uS-hB6Q.mp4,So just to avoid all that keep your hands away from them and me great.
793,7vN6uS-hB6Q.mp4,Thank you.
794,7vN6uS-hB6Q.mp4,Okay.
795,7vN6uS-hB6Q.mp4,Thank you both so much for letting us know what it's like to get a covid test.
796,7vN6uS-hB6Q.mp4,Thank you.
797,7vN6uS-hB6Q.mp4,Alright do it and I thank you so much.
798,7vN6uS-hB6Q.mp4,Thank you.
799,rVBbosPxJ_g.mp4,the CDC has now officially updated the list of symptoms of the coronavirus adding six new possible signs of the disease eyewitness news reporter Courtney Carter spoke to a local doctor and as more details and what you need to look out for according to the CDC initially the most common symptoms of the coronavirus were fever shortness of breath and coughing but doctors say they learn more about the virus every day and through that have been able to identify new symptoms people should watch out for the Centers for Disease Control or CDC has been able to identify now a total of ten official symptoms of the virus that researchers and medical experts are so learning about everyday.
800,rVBbosPxJ_g.mp4,The full list is now chills.
801,rVBbosPxJ_g.mp4,Repeated shaking with chills muscle pain headache sore throat fever new loss of taste or smell cough shortness of breath and difficulty breathing or understanding of this really complex disease continues to evolve and as Physicians caring for people with covid-19.
802,rVBbosPxJ_g.mp4,"We've seen that there are typical symptoms of fever cough and shortness of breath, but we've also learned that there are a lot of atypical symptoms as well and the list of those a typical symptoms is growing nearly day by day at this point."
803,rVBbosPxJ_g.mp4,Dr. Laura Foreman chief of emergency medicine.
804,rVBbosPxJ_g.mp4,At Kent Hospital says medical officials have been seen the new symptoms for a period of time.
805,rVBbosPxJ_g.mp4,But only recently after seeing more and more patients.
806,rVBbosPxJ_g.mp4,Could the CDC make it official I've been reported in.
807,rVBbosPxJ_g.mp4,Medical literature along with a number of other symptoms.
808,rVBbosPxJ_g.mp4,"So they've added these new ones to the list I think because they've become six of the more common symptoms, but we've been saying that for quite some time with dr. Foreman wants to remind you that it's important to remember it may take time to see symptoms at all."
809,rVBbosPxJ_g.mp4,Typically 2 to 14 days after exposure and some testing positive are still asymptomatic.
810,rVBbosPxJ_g.mp4,This is a really confounding disease and in the medical community community.
811,rVBbosPxJ_g.mp4,We're literally working around the clock trying to better understand it trying to better understand how to prevent.
812,rVBbosPxJ_g.mp4,Eat it how to treat it how to keep people safe from it.
813,rVBbosPxJ_g.mp4,Now the CDC recommends that you should take immediate emergency care.
814,rVBbosPxJ_g.mp4,"If you have any of the following symptoms, and those are a bluish tint to your face or mouth area trouble breathing pain in the chest or confusion."
815,rVBbosPxJ_g.mp4,I'm Courtney Carter Eyewitness News.
816,QjEfy54R3mc.mp4,"We Begin this hour with the latest on the race for a vaccine for covid-19 and a bump in the road for a major clinical trial that Ottowa hopes will eventually provide tens of millions of doses for Canadians Johnson & Johnson's had to put it's crucial late-stage testing in humans on hold at least for now Laura McClellan leads off this hour she has all the details Laura good morning good morning here the the company's not saying what kind of an unexplained illness this trial participant It has they're citing privacy is to why they can't do that, but they did Issue a statement last night."
817,QjEfy54R3mc.mp4,They wanted to assuage people that phase 3 trials are meant to catch any kind of side effects such as this as well as proving that the vaccine works.
818,QjEfy54R3mc.mp4,"So take a look at what Johnson Johnson is saying in the statement, they say that serious Adverse Events are not uncommon in clinical trials."
819,QjEfy54R3mc.mp4,"And the number of them can reasonably be expected to increase in Trials involving large numbers of participants of which there are set to be 60,000 in this trial."
820,QjEfy54R3mc.mp4,Go on to say that further is many trials are placebo-controlled.
821,QjEfy54R3mc.mp4,It's not always immediately apparent whether a participant received a study treatment or a placebo important Point here.
822,QjEfy54R3mc.mp4,"They're not saying at this point whether this volunteer in the trial had their vaccine or if they had a placebo so they don't know that but as yet hitting pause for now and it's unclear how long that will be for but Johnson & Johnson says, this is all going to be looked at by an independent review board."
823,QjEfy54R3mc.mp4,It monitors the data the safety of all of us as well as internal clinicians will be taking a close.
824,QjEfy54R3mc.mp4,"Look at what's gone on what kind of illnesses and how that might relate to the vaccine and anyway worth noting as well that this is one of ten vaccines already in Phase 3 Johnson & Johnson only began its phase 3 trial last month and it is a little bit behind some of those other drug makers, but this is a big trial they were on track to get this out the door end of this year or early next year Heather."
825,QjEfy54R3mc.mp4,So we have to wait and see what this kind of disruption might mean with them now putting it on pause.
826,QjEfy54R3mc.mp4,"And with that independent roof review rather Laura underway, which is exactly how it was handled in another company's late-stage trial."
827,QjEfy54R3mc.mp4,That's right AstraZeneca.
828,QjEfy54R3mc.mp4,We were telling you about this last month that trial also known as the Oxford University trial.
829,QjEfy54R3mc.mp4,It's actually been paused twice because two participants have fallen ill in July and September and that first instance.
830,QjEfy54R3mc.mp4,It was found that that participant didn't have an illness related to the vaccine.
831,QjEfy54R3mc.mp4,"The second isn't entirely clear at this point, but It has been able to resume that trial everywhere that it was carrying it out except for the US where some more approvals are needed."
832,QjEfy54R3mc.mp4,Now.
833,QjEfy54R3mc.mp4,A lot of people will be wondering.
834,QjEfy54R3mc.mp4,Okay.
835,QjEfy54R3mc.mp4,What does this mean for a vaccine?
836,QjEfy54R3mc.mp4,Is it going to be safe and that's a point that infectious disease experts are speaking a lot about in the past 12 or so hours since this news came out.
837,QjEfy54R3mc.mp4,They are pointing out that this is what the phase 3 trial is meant to do was meant to find any issues before the vaccine gets to Market and when we spoke to infectious disease specialist.
838,QjEfy54R3mc.mp4,Dr. Isaac bogus just a Short time ago he said he'll be watching closely to find out what answers on that front.
839,QjEfy54R3mc.mp4,But that this is an important backstop take a listen.
840,QjEfy54R3mc.mp4,"This is basically standard process for a clinical trial if someone gets sick for any reason whatsoever vaccine or non vaccine-related, they're going to push pause and they're going to investigate to make sure that it truly isn't vaccine-related."
841,QjEfy54R3mc.mp4,We'll hear more about what this is in the hopefully in the days to come and we'll have a better understanding of whether or not it's related to the vaccine or not.
842,QjEfy54R3mc.mp4,"So we watching For any updates, of course here there but the message from Specialists like dr. Bowe gosh is the system is working by having this pause in place."
843,QjEfy54R3mc.mp4,So just keep tuned for whatever else might come out about that illness and whether it does link back to the vaccine Laura.
844,QjEfy54R3mc.mp4,Thank you very much Laura.

863,OSAuyLlJStw.mp4,The last set of figures are over a billion children out of school children and youth school closures and over a hundred 80 countries around the world nationwide at this point.
864,OSAuyLlJStw.mp4,It's affecting a virtually the entire world right now.
865,OSAuyLlJStw.mp4,The world's largest homeschooling experiment is taking place millions of parents across the country are struggling as they try to homeschool their children.
866,OSAuyLlJStw.mp4,"Governor's order to close schools takes effect for everyone school closures, very Likely schools would resume this school year."
867,OSAuyLlJStw.mp4,We know the impact of this virus will be far-reaching.
868,OSAuyLlJStw.mp4,"But what does it mean for educational institutions and the children learning within them everybody is having a major change, but if they're living this experience very differently, and I think that's something we really need to keep in mind when we're thinking about Solutions as well to recognize the diversity of experience and my name is Tracy Burns, and I'm a senior Analyst at the oecd the organization."
869,OSAuyLlJStw.mp4,Action for economic cooperation and development.
870,OSAuyLlJStw.mp4,"I think that the goal for everyone would be to limit the closure as much as possible within considerations of the public health imperative, of course, not just for learning but also just because school when we think about it, I think people are getting a renewed appreciation of this is school is is more than a building."
871,OSAuyLlJStw.mp4,It's part of the social fabric of Our Lives of children's lives.
872,OSAuyLlJStw.mp4,"schools closed their doors many Educators have turned to online teaching to connect with their students Technologies stepped in to fill the void left by classrooms, but it's also creating a deepening inequality between those who have the tools to access materials and those who don't There's a lot of concern within the education field and and sort of public health field about seeing increasing inequality as a result of this crisis because the kids who are already at risk are more likely to suffer are less likely to have the access less likely to have the skills to use the devices if they do have access to them."
873,OSAuyLlJStw.mp4,And so they're more likely to fall behind.
874,OSAuyLlJStw.mp4,This could become quite easily a vicious cycle.
875,OSAuyLlJStw.mp4,I mean one of the challenges I think is the expectation that is put on a parent.
876,OSAuyLlJStw.mp4,It's lunch time and I'm hiding in my son's room.
877,OSAuyLlJStw.mp4,I just feel really defeated.
878,OSAuyLlJStw.mp4,We were literally given notice.
879,OSAuyLlJStw.mp4,So there's no preparation.
880,OSAuyLlJStw.mp4,"Yes, I'm overwhelmed."
881,OSAuyLlJStw.mp4,I don't know where to find the resources.
882,OSAuyLlJStw.mp4,They know.
883,OSAuyLlJStw.mp4,It's a burden to your regular routine.
884,OSAuyLlJStw.mp4,We're lucky in our family that I may be able to be here with them.
885,OSAuyLlJStw.mp4,Even the most skilled educator as a hard time balancing different demands and personalizing learning for very different groups of children.
886,OSAuyLlJStw.mp4,So one of the things I think that's really a clear take-home from the parent side is is to it's okay to do your best and it's okay to it's okay to know to not be perfect.
887,OSAuyLlJStw.mp4,The most important things for parents to do is self-care because in it so many mothers try to be teacher and mother at the same time and it is just impossible for them to take on the role of a teacher.
888,OSAuyLlJStw.mp4,My name is dr. Miller.
889,OSAuyLlJStw.mp4,Ciao.
890,OSAuyLlJStw.mp4,I'm a Clinical psychologist specializing in children and Adolescent there are many families experience in doing homeschooling and no matter how hard you try and it is a profession on its own.
891,OSAuyLlJStw.mp4,"Some children, you know, they pay attention span is very short."
892,OSAuyLlJStw.mp4,They're not going to be talking to you in front of the computer for like an hour.
893,OSAuyLlJStw.mp4,They're not so those are the ones who is going to be having a hard time falling behind.
894,OSAuyLlJStw.mp4,One of the open questions of course is the emotional impact because this is very destabilizing for students.
895,OSAuyLlJStw.mp4,"The teachers parents all of us in fact, and that's where there's it's a lot less clear you guys like going to school more or learning at home."
896,OSAuyLlJStw.mp4,I prefer school because there we can co-teachers befriends.
897,OSAuyLlJStw.mp4,Yeah.
898,OSAuyLlJStw.mp4,I also prefer School guess.
899,OSAuyLlJStw.mp4,"Yeah, you can see your friends and I really miss them."
900,OSAuyLlJStw.mp4,I think the inside is too it's coming.
901,OSAuyLlJStw.mp4,"From the uncertainty about when is that going to end but nobody can tell them and I think that is, you know, unsettling."
902,OSAuyLlJStw.mp4,I do want to look at the positive of children.
903,OSAuyLlJStw.mp4,There's very resilient.
904,OSAuyLlJStw.mp4,As parents teachers and children begin to adjust to the new way of learning.
905,OSAuyLlJStw.mp4,It's worth acknowledging that some of the practices being used could be seen again after restrictions are eased before the covid-19 outbreak Educators globally had been in talks about the need to bring education systems into the 21st century.
906,OSAuyLlJStw.mp4,This may be the disruption needed for the sector to rethink how to educate future Generations.
907,Iyy83bYicqQ.mp4,Welcome back to Critical Care Survival Guide.
908,Iyy83bYicqQ.mp4,We're doing a series on covid-19.
909,Iyy83bYicqQ.mp4,We're getting a lot of questions about this and particularly about how to stay safe how to understand the difference between aerosols and droplets what that means for healthcare providers in terms of PPE and how you can better understand how to take care of these patients that come in eating different types of oxygen delivery devices the basics start with a cough that's what these patients are coming in with their coughing and when we call for when we seeIs we emit large droplets large droplets?
910,Iyy83bYicqQ.mp4,If someone sitting next to you could land on somebody else they could inhale it and they could contract the virus if the large droplets land on a piece of plastic or a doorknob somebody comes along and touches that doorknob then touches their face.
911,Iyy83bYicqQ.mp4,They could also get the virus.
912,Iyy83bYicqQ.mp4,That's the main form of transmission of covid-19.
913,Iyy83bYicqQ.mp4,Another thing we're paying particularly close attention to is aerosols aerosols are a bit different than large droplets aerosols are more like a Mist you can think of it like a a spray bottle or power washer or it have fine particles that come up to into the air and they hang out and they stay floating in the air for a longer period of time than the large droplets.
914,Iyy83bYicqQ.mp4,This means if somebody else comes walking by they might inhale those find aerosols and get sick and get the virus.
915,Iyy83bYicqQ.mp4,Okay.
916,Iyy83bYicqQ.mp4,So what do we do about this?
917,Iyy83bYicqQ.mp4,"Well for starters to prevent large droplet spread we're asking people to wear masks if you cough or sneeze into a mask, there's less risk of those large droplets landing on somebody else or on a We're knob you get the drift for patients that are requiring devices that are going to emit aerosols."
918,Iyy83bYicqQ.mp4,"For example, a high-flow nasal."
919,Iyy83bYicqQ.mp4,Cannula CPAP or BiPAP a ventilator where a nebulizer is going in all of these things have a risk of emitting aerosols into the room.
920,Iyy83bYicqQ.mp4,We want as much as we possibly can those rooms to be negative air flow.
921,Iyy83bYicqQ.mp4,We want to be turning over the air and those rooms to eliminate the aerosols as fast as possible in addition.
922,Iyy83bYicqQ.mp4,We want providers to Be wearing PPE that includes an n95 tightly fitting and fit-tested mask that blocks aerosol inhalation.
923,Iyy83bYicqQ.mp4,In addition things like eye protection gowns gloves.
924,Iyy83bYicqQ.mp4,This is what we're recommending for covid-19.
925,Iyy83bYicqQ.mp4,"We're worried both about large droplet transmission, which is the main mechanism of transmission in our community, but in hospitals where we're seeing devices used were also worried about aerosols which is why you see a lot of attention given lately to n95 s- airflow rooms and the like thanks again for tuning in to cook."
926,Iyy83bYicqQ.mp4,"Care Survival Guide, please do subscribe and let us know what else you'd like to learn about."
927,bBUbfLHK3oI.mp4,"As a medical doctor, it's in my opinion that the data exists to show that The Masks basking is one of the most important things that we can do and then absolutely curves the spread of covid and that's an important thing because I've had a chance to study covid and I know more than anyone else because I'm a researcher just how important prevention is."
928,bBUbfLHK3oI.mp4,It's just like cancer heart disease diabetes anything else.
929,bBUbfLHK3oI.mp4,We want to avoid this if we can and so for right now masking is Is to me a second nature thing that we got to do is kind of like brushing your teeth before you go to bed at night or when you get in the car putting on your seatbelt or stopping at the stop line is just simply one of those things that keeps everyone safe.
930,bBUbfLHK3oI.mp4,These are the comparison of blood vessels and the lung now on the left you can actually see what a healthy lung looks like.
931,bBUbfLHK3oI.mp4,There's blood vessels that are there and they're beautiful Lacy blood vessels in a wrapped around an air pocket and on the right you can actually see is after covid-19.
932,bBUbfLHK3oI.mp4,This is a respiratory virus.
933,bBUbfLHK3oI.mp4,Infected the limit you can see how completely changes the long it's not a very pretty picture now.
934,bBUbfLHK3oI.mp4,I do want to emphasize that these changes are in the lungs of people who had severe covid and died.
935,bBUbfLHK3oI.mp4,"And even though we looked at every patient and we found this in every patient we examine it's really too early to say for sure that everyone who gets a coronavirus looking to suffer from these changes, but this is actually part of what we're learning."
936,bBUbfLHK3oI.mp4,This is something you definitely we all definitely want to avoid now.
937,bBUbfLHK3oI.mp4,We're going to talk about masks.
938,bBUbfLHK3oI.mp4,Since we know that we still unfortunately need to be wearing them.
939,bBUbfLHK3oI.mp4,"And yes, everybody sick of it."
940,bBUbfLHK3oI.mp4,Of course.
941,bBUbfLHK3oI.mp4,This is actually a study from Duke University.
942,bBUbfLHK3oI.mp4,So one of the great universities of our country and they published a study taking a look at which masks were most effective to protect us and surprisingly they also took a look at which mass that you don't really work at all.
943,bBUbfLHK3oI.mp4,"So what I want to do is to walk you guys through, you know, three masks that work into that don't work really well."
944,bBUbfLHK3oI.mp4,This study actually looked at the fitted and 95 Which is what health care workers actually have in the beginning of this is what we all heard about is that in 95 and it's not surprising that that's one of the best because that's what health care workers use in the hospital to say state gets them their Badges of Honor on their faces.
945,bBUbfLHK3oI.mp4,That's right.
946,bBUbfLHK3oI.mp4,You got to have it fitted.
947,bBUbfLHK3oI.mp4,"It actually seals around the face, but here's the deal."
948,bBUbfLHK3oI.mp4,You don't really need to freak out about trying to find one of these things because they're still being reserved and saved for our health care workers the k95 is that you more available.
949,bBUbfLHK3oI.mp4,They're not exactly the same there.
950,bBUbfLHK3oI.mp4,Pretty good.
951,bBUbfLHK3oI.mp4,"But in this study, you know the next best mass to the K and K 95s KN under fives and and 95s actually are the procedure masks."
952,bBUbfLHK3oI.mp4,Now.
953,bBUbfLHK3oI.mp4,These are pretty easy to get any important thing about these is they're also surgical mass at their what your dental hygienists where so you can they're comfortable you can wear them all day and surgeons will wear them for hours.
954,bBUbfLHK3oI.mp4,I'll give you a little orientation.
955,bBUbfLHK3oI.mp4,There's a top and a bottom and the top actually has this wire wire it rich When you wear it bend it around your nose just like this.
956,bBUbfLHK3oI.mp4,This is how you put it on your ear.
957,bBUbfLHK3oI.mp4,Get a really good shit to write down over your chin.
958,bBUbfLHK3oI.mp4,Pull it down over your chin.
959,bBUbfLHK3oI.mp4,"Okay, really comfortable to wear and the thing is that we've got the data that this actually works."
960,bBUbfLHK3oI.mp4,"You know, it's pretty good."
961,bBUbfLHK3oI.mp4,It's the next best thing to an end on D5 and the key thing is that these are easy to get they are single-use only.
962,bBUbfLHK3oI.mp4,"So when you're done with them, you just toss them out this research from Duke University actually showed that poly-cotton masks like the one you have Ari Equally effective as the procedure or surgical masks as long as they have two or three layers now three layers are better than two and I have one right here."
963,bBUbfLHK3oI.mp4,You can see there's a front layer with blue and there's a white layer and back.
964,bBUbfLHK3oI.mp4,There's another one on the end time inside two layers is just fine.
965,bBUbfLHK3oI.mp4,You don't need to add a filter.
966,bBUbfLHK3oI.mp4,They're really comfortable.
967,bBUbfLHK3oI.mp4,They're convenient and they are washable.
968,bBUbfLHK3oI.mp4,So I want to show you to mass that kind of flunk.
969,bBUbfLHK3oI.mp4,"The test is what I would call it and one of them is something that we've all seen and that is the bandana, right?"
970,bBUbfLHK3oI.mp4,We've seen people walking around with these Is right and what they actually found is that wearing a bandana is definitely better than not we're a mess but it's only a little bit better than nothing at all.
971,bBUbfLHK3oI.mp4,So not that great.
972,bBUbfLHK3oI.mp4,"So when I see somebody wearing a bandana like I sort of step away, it's just not a good one."
973,bBUbfLHK3oI.mp4,But there's a worse one and the worst one actually surprisingly is this we've seen these before the neck gaiter.
974,bBUbfLHK3oI.mp4,"Is it worse than wearing nothing, you know, it's hard to believe but that It's actually what they found in this published study and the explanation is that the shape of the Gator allows respiratory droplets to actually become finer and then the shape of the Gator allows these droplets to finer drop is to spray out in the air, which is worse than not wearing a mask at all."
975,bBUbfLHK3oI.mp4,And can I just leave your viewers with three things one?
976,bBUbfLHK3oI.mp4,"It's sooo simple where Mast is going to protect you and protect other people number two, keep a safe distance and number three wash your hands."
977,CVvGvoMRUhk.mp4,The current challenges brought about by covid-19 for people all around the globe are unparalleled and of caused fear anxiety and uncertainty for so many of us.
978,CVvGvoMRUhk.mp4,We are all going through this together and it's important to understand that you're not alone and how you're feeling right now and that there are practical healthy ways to cope with these emotions.The covid-19 pandemic has created unprecedented change and a need for a response from everyone around the globe many of us are worried about our loved ones in our livelihoods.
979,CVvGvoMRUhk.mp4,And there is no one right way to cope with what we're experiencing.
980,CVvGvoMRUhk.mp4,"Remember, however, you're feeling there are others that feel the same You are not alone."
981,CVvGvoMRUhk.mp4,Here are a few voices of people struggling to cope during this time some days.
982,CVvGvoMRUhk.mp4,I'm okay.
983,CVvGvoMRUhk.mp4,I am doing my best to adjust.
984,CVvGvoMRUhk.mp4,But yesterday I couldn't stop crying this all just seems so unfair that I feel so angry that this is happening to us.
985,CVvGvoMRUhk.mp4,"I'm struggling to care for my kids and work from home at the same time, and I'm worried about my parents."
986,CVvGvoMRUhk.mp4,It's health I watch the news and it just seems so hopeless.
987,CVvGvoMRUhk.mp4,I don't know how to keep it together.
988,CVvGvoMRUhk.mp4,I feel so lost and sad so much has changed.
989,CVvGvoMRUhk.mp4,I used to have dinner every week with my family.
990,CVvGvoMRUhk.mp4,But now I can't be in the same room with them.
991,CVvGvoMRUhk.mp4,I really miss them.
992,CVvGvoMRUhk.mp4,I'm missing out on my prom and my graduation.
993,CVvGvoMRUhk.mp4,I've literally been looking forward to these things my whole life and I'm heartbroken with everything going on.
994,CVvGvoMRUhk.mp4,Now.
995,CVvGvoMRUhk.mp4,I just can't stop my thoughts and physically my chest hurts and I can't breathe.
996,CVvGvoMRUhk.mp4,I get nauseous thinking about what could happen to my family and my friends before this happened.
997,CVvGvoMRUhk.mp4,I used to worry all the time about getting sick.
998,CVvGvoMRUhk.mp4,Now that worry has turned into absolute Terror my heart races every time I have to go to the store.
999,CVvGvoMRUhk.mp4,What if I bring germs home with me?
1000,CVvGvoMRUhk.mp4,I can't stop washing my hands no matter how exhausted I am.
1001,CVvGvoMRUhk.mp4,My sleep is still terrible.
1002,CVvGvoMRUhk.mp4,I just keep picturing all the things that could possibly happen.
1003,CVvGvoMRUhk.mp4,Will I ever get a good night's sleep again.
1004,CVvGvoMRUhk.mp4,I've been through so much already.
1005,CVvGvoMRUhk.mp4,I don't know how I'm going to deal with this to my flashbacks her getting worse and worse.
1006,CVvGvoMRUhk.mp4,"Honestly, I feel like I'm more comfortable in times of Crisis."
1007,CVvGvoMRUhk.mp4,I'm not sure why I don't feel as upset as everyone.
1008,CVvGvoMRUhk.mp4,Else does right now I don't know when or if everything is going to get back to normal.
1009,CVvGvoMRUhk.mp4,I feel like the weight of the world is on my shoulders.
1010,CVvGvoMRUhk.mp4,How many people are going to be affected?
1011,CVvGvoMRUhk.mp4,What does this mean for me and my family?
1012,CVvGvoMRUhk.mp4,We've just heard some of the ways people are being affected by the covid-19 situation.
1013,CVvGvoMRUhk.mp4,Here are some things that are helpful in building resilience during times of Crisis and intense stress.
1014,CVvGvoMRUhk.mp4,"There are a lot of things outside of our control right now, which can be scary by focusing on the things we can control we can refuel ourselves and become more grounded and able to focus and cope with all of the things."
1015,CVvGvoMRUhk.mp4,We can't control one of the most important actions within your control is to follow CDC guidelines to reduce your Of being exposed or passing the virus on to others.
1016,CVvGvoMRUhk.mp4,Use social support.
1017,CVvGvoMRUhk.mp4,No one should go through this alone.
1018,CVvGvoMRUhk.mp4,There is absolutely no shame and talking about what you're going through with your friends and family and it's important to be there for others to video chat and phone calls are a great way to stay connected.
1019,CVvGvoMRUhk.mp4,prioritize self care staying on a regular schedule exercising eating a healthy diet keeping a sleep routine and taking time to meditate or pray are all important now more than ever.
1020,CVvGvoMRUhk.mp4,Be gentle with yourself.

1022,CVvGvoMRUhk.mp4,You will have good days and bad days.
1023,CVvGvoMRUhk.mp4,Your emotions are most likely heightened at this time.
1024,CVvGvoMRUhk.mp4,Try not to compare your life to what you see on your friends.
1025,CVvGvoMRUhk.mp4,Social media feeds.
1026,CVvGvoMRUhk.mp4,There is always more going on behind screens.
1027,CVvGvoMRUhk.mp4,Helping others can bring joy and gratification do what you can to help others.
1028,CVvGvoMRUhk.mp4,Even if it's something as simple as lending an ear or making someone smile be kind to the people around you especially the folks who are still out working to ensure.

1036,D9tTi-CDjDU.mp4,For almost a decade scientist chased the source of a deadly new virus through China's tallest mountains and most isolated Caverns.
1037,D9tTi-CDjDU.mp4,They finally found it here in the bats of shitao cave.
1038,D9tTi-CDjDU.mp4,The virus in question was a coronavirus that caused an epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome or SARS in 2003.
1039,D9tTi-CDjDU.mp4,Three coronavirus has are a group of viruses covered in little protein spikes that look like a crown or Corona in Latin.
1040,D9tTi-CDjDU.mp4,There are hundreds of known coronavirus has seven of them infect humans and can cause disease the coronavirus SARS Covey causes SARS MERS Covey causes Mayors and SARS Covey to causes the disease covid-19 of the seven human coronaviruses that fool Cause colds mild highly contagious infections of the nose and throat to in fact the lungs and cause much more severe illnesses the seventh which causes covid-19 has features of each.
1041,D9tTi-CDjDU.mp4,"It spreads easily, but can severely impact the lungs when an infected person coughs droplets containing the virus spray out."
1042,D9tTi-CDjDU.mp4,"The virus can infect a new person when the droplets enter their nose or mouth coronavirus is MIT best in enclosed spaces where people are close together cold weather keeps their delicate casing from drying out enabling the virus to survive for longer between hosts while UV exposure from sunlight may damage it these seasonal variations matter more for established viruses, but because no one is yet immune to a new virus."
1043,D9tTi-CDjDU.mp4,It has so many potential hosts that it doesn't need ideal conditions to spread in the body the protein spikes in bed in the host cells and fused with them.
1044,D9tTi-CDjDU.mp4,Enabling the virus to hijack the host cells Machinery to replicate its own genes.
1045,D9tTi-CDjDU.mp4,Coronavirus is stored their genes on RNA all viruses that either RNA viruses or DNA viruses RNA viruses tend to be smaller with fewer genes meaning they infect many hosts and replicate quickly in those hosts in general.
1046,D9tTi-CDjDU.mp4,RNA viruses don't have a proofreading mechanism whereas DNA viruses do so when an RNA virus replicates its much.
1047,D9tTi-CDjDU.mp4,Much more likely to have mistakes called mutations many of these mutations are useless or even harmful but some make the virus better suited for certain environments like a new host species epidemics often occur.
1048,D9tTi-CDjDU.mp4,When a virus jumps from animals to humans.
1049,D9tTi-CDjDU.mp4,"This is true of the RNA viruses that cause the bowler zika and SARS epidemics and the covid-19 pandemic once in humans, the virus still mutates, usually not enough to cause Ate a new virus but enough to create variations or strains of the original one coronavirus is have a few key differences from most RNA viruses the some of the largest meaning they have the most genes that creates more opportunity for harmful mutations to counteract this risk coronavirus have a unique feature an enzyme that checks for replication errors and correct mistakes."
1050,D9tTi-CDjDU.mp4,This makes coronavirus has much more stable with a slower mutation rate than our RNA viruses are this may sound formidable.
1051,D9tTi-CDjDU.mp4,Thus low mutation rate is actually a promising sign when it comes to disarming them after an infection.
1052,D9tTi-CDjDU.mp4,"Our immune systems can recognize germs and Destroy them more quickly if they infect us again, so they don't make us sick."
1053,D9tTi-CDjDU.mp4,The mutations can make a virus less recognizable to our immune systems and therefore more difficult to fight off.
1054,D9tTi-CDjDU.mp4,They can also make antiviral drugs and vaccines less effective because they're tailored very specifically.
1055,D9tTi-CDjDU.mp4,You a virus that's why we need a new flu vaccine every year the influenza virus mutates.
1056,D9tTi-CDjDU.mp4,So quickly that new strains pop up constantly.
1057,D9tTi-CDjDU.mp4,Thus low mutation rate of coronavirus has means our immune systems drugs and vaccines might be able to recognize them for longer after infection and therefore protect us better still.
1058,D9tTi-CDjDU.mp4,We don't know how long our bodies remain immune to different coronavirus has there's never been an approved treatment or vaccine for a Coronavirus.
1059,D9tTi-CDjDU.mp4,We haven't focused on treating the ones that cause colds and though scientists began developing treatments for SARS and mares the epidemics ended before those treatments completed clinical trials as we continue to encroach on other animals habitats.
1060,D9tTi-CDjDU.mp4,Some scientists.
1061,D9tTi-CDjDU.mp4,Say a new coronavirus jump into humans is inevitable.
1062,D9tTi-CDjDU.mp4,"But if we investigate these unknowns, it doesn't have to be devastated."
1063,D9tTi-CDjDU.mp4,Students and teachers all over the world did their part to help slow the spread of covid-19 by staying home.
1064,D9tTi-CDjDU.mp4,But what about their graduation ceremonies?

1104,uLVDBifWbAg.mp4,They discuss this topic emergency warning stands about a covid-19.
1105,uLVDBifWbAg.mp4,If you develop emergency warning saying for cold weather 19 get a medical attention immediately.
1106,uLVDBifWbAg.mp4,emergency warning said included why trouble breathing?
1107,uLVDBifWbAg.mp4,We can draw men with trouble breathing.
1108,uLVDBifWbAg.mp4,This is a man and hey had a trouble breathing 2% in pain operator in a chest.
1109,uLVDBifWbAg.mp4,Now we can draw a main with pain and predator in the chest is the mean and this is the chest and he has P operator in the chest.

1116,9JxnRJINn-o.mp4,Sounds kind of e 2 is the coronavirus responsible for causing the ongoing covid-19 pandemic.
1117,9JxnRJINn-o.mp4,The genetic material of the virus is encapsulated within a membrane.
1118,9JxnRJINn-o.mp4,The external surface of the membrane is studded with a viral protein called Spike the spike protein gives the virus its characteristic appearance of a crown.
1119,9JxnRJINn-o.mp4,Despite broken is the key player in source code to infection.
1120,9JxnRJINn-o.mp4,Is it recognizes and attaches to the surface of human cells inside the body?
1121,9JxnRJINn-o.mp4,Once attached the virus is then able to invade the cell inside the cell its genetic material is released and the virus begins to replicate.
1122,9JxnRJINn-o.mp4,The infection process in human cells can be observed with a microscope in the laboratory in this image infected cells are labeled in green and the spread of the infection can be observed over time.
1123,9JxnRJINn-o.mp4,In order to bind human cells the viral Spike protein recognizes and makes contact with the receptor called a stew on the cell surface the reaction between a stew and Spike helps the virus to stick to cells and triggers this internalization.
1124,9JxnRJINn-o.mp4,"In this study, we discovered a secondary receptor that the virus recognizes to cause infection."
1125,9JxnRJINn-o.mp4,This receptor called neural pill in one or abbreviated to enter P1 is also contacted by the spike protein.
1126,9JxnRJINn-o.mp4,We found that the presence of naropa lead one at the cell surface significantly enhanced infection and spread of the virus in human cells as seen in this magnified image.
1127,9JxnRJINn-o.mp4,To understand this phenomenon in more detail.
1128,9JxnRJINn-o.mp4,We investigated the biochemical basis of the interaction between European one and the virus Spike protein.
1129,9JxnRJINn-o.mp4,This is a molecular model that shows the key proteins that are involved in the interface between the virus and the human cell the psych protein makes contact with a stew and European one is contacts announce the entry of the virus into cells where it then replicates to cause infection.
1130,9JxnRJINn-o.mp4,Using biochemical techniques we next for the state on the details of the interaction between Spike and European one.
1131,9JxnRJINn-o.mp4,The biochemical structure of this interaction reveals a three-dimensional binding pocket present on the surface of naropa and one the viral Spike protein sends a finger like projection into this binding pocket to engage the newer open and one receptor.
1132,9JxnRJINn-o.mp4,This binding process resembles on outstretched hand coming from Europe in and one that the spike protein grabs hold off in order to gain entry into human cells.
1133,9JxnRJINn-o.mp4,In this video we focus directly into the biochemistry of this process The Binding pocket of nierop in and one is labeled in white and finger-like projections of the spike protein occupying that space is in blue.
1134,9JxnRJINn-o.mp4,Crucially.
1135,9JxnRJINn-o.mp4,We found that a drug that also fits into this binding pocket overlaid here in Orange was able to block the viral Spike protein from binding to new European and one by outcompeting this binding pocket.
1136,9JxnRJINn-o.mp4,This raises the possibility that drugs targeting neuro pin and one may be used to prevent the viral Spike protein from exploiting it to enter human cells.
1137,9JxnRJINn-o.mp4,The impact of blocking European one in human cells can be clearly observed when cells were treated with a drug or antibody blocking this interaction the levels of infection and spread of the virus were significantly reduced.
1138,9JxnRJINn-o.mp4,Together these results implicate new repealing one as an important host factor for source code to infection and suggests that blocking European one may be an important therapeutic intervention in the treatment of covid-19.
1139,LfpbRQIa_Zo.mp4,Most people recover from covid-19 as of April 30th.
1140,LfpbRQIa_Zo.mp4,We're looking at more than 1 million survivors globally and if we consider people who haven't been tested that number is probably much higher but the road to recovery isn't always a smooth one.
1141,LfpbRQIa_Zo.mp4,Here's what it's like to get better from covid-19 day by day.
1142,LfpbRQIa_Zo.mp4,"Generally, the sicker a person is the longer it takes to recover but there's still a lot."
1143,LfpbRQIa_Zo.mp4,We don't know about covid-19 because it's not just about how you feel.
1144,LfpbRQIa_Zo.mp4,"We have to talk about transmissibility to mild cases, which are about 80% of all confirmed cases can run the gamut from asymptomatic to more serious asymptomatic cases are important because even if people don't show symptoms, they can still transmit the virus."
1145,LfpbRQIa_Zo.mp4,The CDC estimates that as many as 25 percent of people who are infected won't show symptoms.
1146,LfpbRQIa_Zo.mp4,These people should only break isolation after seven days have passed since their first positive test and no symptoms show up within that time frame mild cases with symptoms usually don't require a stay in a hospital and can be managed from home recovery can take about two weeks in that time fatigue muscle aches and chest discomfort should start to ease if they have a fever it.
1147,LfpbRQIa_Zo.mp4,Most likely settle after a week though a cough might linger a little longer if patients were officially diagnosed with covid-19 and sent home the CDC recommends.
1148,LfpbRQIa_Zo.mp4,They meet three criteria before breaking self-isolation.
1149,LfpbRQIa_Zo.mp4,They've been fever free for 72 hours respiratory symptoms like chest pain or a cough have cleared up and at least seven days have passed since they saw their first symptoms.
1150,LfpbRQIa_Zo.mp4,"Since it's not fully known how long covid-19 patients are contagious for some experts believe these current CDC guidelines aren't conservative enough moderate cases are even tougher to categorize some of these will follow a similar timeline as mild ones, but some might start to look better after about a week and then suddenly get worse this could land them in the hospital for two to three days."
1151,LfpbRQIa_Zo.mp4,Some patients with high fevers and diarrhea might get dehydrated and require IV fluids and since this virus mainly attacks the respiratory system a heightened immune response can end up flooding the lungs with fluid.
1152,LfpbRQIa_Zo.mp4,So patients in this category might need supplemental oxygen for a few days to help them breathe better giving a long time to clear up the infection and start working better again.
1153,LfpbRQIa_Zo.mp4,"The when this doesn't work, then we're looking at severe cases symptoms tend to get much worse around the 10-day Mark a severe case is usually marked by pneumonia and recovery time for these patients is around three to six weeks."
1154,LfpbRQIa_Zo.mp4,But pneumonia can sometimes turn into acute respiratory distress syndrome or a RDS.
1155,LfpbRQIa_Zo.mp4,That's when the lungs are flooded with fluid and the body is severely deprived of oxygen a RDS is usually what sends a covid-19 patient to the ICU and the world Organization estimates about 5% of covid-19 cases will end up there.
1156,LfpbRQIa_Zo.mp4,"These are the people who need to be on ventilators machines that move air in and out of the lungs for a patient this provides a greater supply of oxygen to the lungs while removing carbon dioxide some patients may only spend a couple of weeks ventilated and then a few days recovering in a medical or surgical Ward, but ventilation can be an uncomfortable and traumatic process patients will need medication to relieve the discomfort many get All doses but higher ones can sometimes induce delirium a change in the brain that can cause mental or emotional confusion and it can have a lasting impact on the recovery process even potentially causing PTSD."
1157,LfpbRQIa_Zo.mp4,"So ventilators are often times The Last Resort a patient is taken off a ventilator after meeting three criteria, they're able to control their breathing and swallowing on their own their oxygen levels are high enough that they can be supported by something less invasive like a nasal cannula."
1158,LfpbRQIa_Zo.mp4,Their lungs can clear carbon dioxide effectively enough not to need assistance once off the ventilator patients usually fall into one of two camps best cases.
1159,LfpbRQIa_Zo.mp4,"They're up and walking some can feel a little weak and might have some weight loss and Mild PTSD, they might be able to just take it easy for a week or two to regain their strength."
1160,LfpbRQIa_Zo.mp4,The worst cases might not be able to get out of bed.
1161,LfpbRQIa_Zo.mp4,"They might be forgetful or confused probably from delirium, but the physical damage would most likely be seen on the lungs after severe respiratory disease and ventilation many patients will have pulmonary fibrosis that could leave the lungs scarred and less functional patients could require Rehabilitation which could mean staying a couple of months in a Skilled Nursing Facility before they can go home and it could take upwards of a year working with psychologists speech therapists and other medical professionals to work through the effects of a ventilator."
1162,LfpbRQIa_Zo.mp4,So in the worst cases after the patient finally leaves the hospital You take up to 18 months before they really feel back to normal.
1163,LfpbRQIa_Zo.mp4,"We're still too early on in this pandemic to know everything about recovery, which is part of the reason the current number of recovered patients is so low many people are still sick, but will eventually get better and the more people who recover the more will learn and vice versa for now."
1164,LfpbRQIa_Zo.mp4,The best thing we can do is try to lessen the number of people who get sick in the first place.
1165,LfpbRQIa_Zo.mp4,So wash your hands keep your distance and be patient.
1166,y76xQkQrFoM.mp4,DC is warning Americans tonight that a coronavirus outbreak is no longer a matter of if but when thanks so much for joining us tonight.
1167,y76xQkQrFoM.mp4,I'm more Lisa Goldsmith and I'm Craig O'Neill Health officials are asking people to take precautions as the virus spreads to more countries teach feel Evans Melissa sigilyph.
1168,y76xQkQrFoM.mp4,Spoke with the Arkansas Department of Health about what it's doing to prepare and if an outbreak is likely here in Arkansas.
1169,y76xQkQrFoM.mp4,The good news is Arkansas still has zero cases of the coronavirus also known as covid-19.
1170,y76xQkQrFoM.mp4,We don't have anyone right now that we're evaluating but dr. Jennifer Dylan.
1171,y76xQkQrFoM.mp4,Hey with the Arkansas Department of Health tells me a spread in communities in the US and here in Arkansas is a very real possibility and it's something the department is getting ready for phone calls with the CVC everyday and we're meeting to revise our plans.
1172,y76xQkQrFoM.mp4,"The health department has been in four years what to do in the case of an influenza pandemic which happens when a new virus that is different from the seasonal flu viruses emerges and spreads quickly officials are adjusting that plan for the coronavirus because it spreads through the air like the flu the plan includes canceling or discouraging large community Gatherings, like concerts or football games schools would likely be closed and employers would be encouraged to have their employees work from home and it very it may vary from Community to community and where the spread is other countries where there is a covid-19 outbreak already have similar plans in place."
1173,y76xQkQrFoM.mp4,The virus has spread to 32 countries including Italy and South Korea were a level 3 travel advisory was just put in place.
1174,y76xQkQrFoM.mp4,They've also issued an alert to ask people to reconsider cruise ships in the Asian area so far and the u.s. 14 coronavirus cases have been diagnosed in.
1175,y76xQkQrFoM.mp4,"States 12 of these 14 cases were related to travel to China and two cases are people who live with The Travelers who have developed the virus but no cases have been confirmed through public contact, but that could happen and that's why we're paying very close attention to what's going on in the world and in the us and we're getting ready."
1176,ZpFE1Qm2kJQ.mp4,"Well, it's hard to get a handle on that number around the world obviously in countries like China as you just reported in Italy."
1177,ZpFE1Qm2kJQ.mp4,There are mass closures all across the country here in the United States.
1178,ZpFE1Qm2kJQ.mp4,"It's much more spotty, you know, their individual schools that have closed as cases have been discovered or people have been exposed but there haven't been Mass closings here in the United States yet."
1179,ZpFE1Qm2kJQ.mp4,"Like there have been in other countries now, we do, you know what lessons can be learned from previous Health emergencies, for example to these school closures really help in terms of containing a spread of the virus."
1180,ZpFE1Qm2kJQ.mp4,"Well, you know, I'm certainly not an expert on public health, but based on past experiences."
1181,ZpFE1Qm2kJQ.mp4,That is a tool that I think most school districts will be looking at particularly if they get that advice from their local Public Health Department's one advantage we have today over past outbreaks is that there's much broader internet connectivity.
1182,ZpFE1Qm2kJQ.mp4,So if students do have to learn how to distance there will be much more bandwidth available to many of them though.
1183,ZpFE1Qm2kJQ.mp4,It's certainly not Universal even in the United States.
1184,ZpFE1Qm2kJQ.mp4,"And so then how prepared to do say communities all for the possibility of remote learning, even if they do have the internet access, I mean Artie, Is prepared to their systems in place?"
1185,ZpFE1Qm2kJQ.mp4,"Well, it's really going to vary from school to school and from university university."
1186,ZpFE1Qm2kJQ.mp4,I think some schools may be much better prepare.
1187,ZpFE1Qm2kJQ.mp4,"They may have better technology within the school and available to their students and their teachers other schools particularly those in more rural areas poor schools are not going to have the kind of bandwidth and not going to have the kind of technology and more importantly the training for faculty and staff to be able to move quickly online if necessary and in terms of us having children at home, especially if it's for younger students, How do we know how employers are trying to manage this are they providing parents with some sort of flexible sort of scheduling to be able to take care of the children?"
1188,ZpFE1Qm2kJQ.mp4,"Well, I think many employers are going to have to do that here in the Bay Area."
1189,ZpFE1Qm2kJQ.mp4,A lot of the big tech companies have already asked their employees to start working at home that wasn't because they had children home but because of public health concerns and to try to curtail spread of the coronavirus.
1190,ZpFE1Qm2kJQ.mp4,"So at this point, I think many employers are really looking at that possibility and getting ready to deal with it."
1191,ZpFE1Qm2kJQ.mp4,If there are going to be millions of students here in the United States at home sent home from Cool now homeschooling is a system that's been around for a long time as an alternative to traditional in classroom settings.
1192,ZpFE1Qm2kJQ.mp4,What kind of systems are there for emergency distance learning situations like we're seeing with the coronavirus.
1193,ZpFE1Qm2kJQ.mp4,"Well, I don't think most school districts frankly have had prepara Tory plans like this in case of a public health disaster or some other kind of disaster."
1194,ZpFE1Qm2kJQ.mp4,So I think most students are going to be scrambling to try to deal with something on the kind of scale.
1195,ZpFE1Qm2kJQ.mp4,We're looking at here and obviously schools aren't just way children get educated.
1196,ZpFE1Qm2kJQ.mp4,It's considered a place of security.
1197,ZpFE1Qm2kJQ.mp4,Security and it's also where some children also rely on the food that's provided there.
1198,ZpFE1Qm2kJQ.mp4,Do we know anything about the sort of non-educational challenges and support for students?
1199,ZpFE1Qm2kJQ.mp4,"Well, a lot of it depends upon how long this goes."
1200,ZpFE1Qm2kJQ.mp4,I mean it's one thing if schools are shut down for a week or two.
1201,ZpFE1Qm2kJQ.mp4,"It's another thing if it's from now until the end of the school year or even longer, so I think it does tend to be longer shut down."
1202,ZpFE1Qm2kJQ.mp4,Most schools are going to be thinking about the kind of out of classroom experiences as well as the in classroom learning that goes on to try to figure out how best to support the development of students out.
1203,ZpFE1Qm2kJQ.mp4,Out of the classroom things like nutritional needs physical exercise for gym and things like that.
1204,ZpFE1Qm2kJQ.mp4,Those are all important and the longer this goes on for the longer schools are going to have to figure out how to deal with these issues and a lot of people take for granted.
1205,ZpFE1Qm2kJQ.mp4,"But you know, you can just sort of have a laptop handy have internet access handy, but what about the long-term effect on learning and the ability to keep up with the curriculums being that everyone has different levels of access, right?"
1206,ZpFE1Qm2kJQ.mp4,We really don't have a lot of research on this on coping in an emergency basis.
1207,ZpFE1Qm2kJQ.mp4,We certainly have good research on.
1208,ZpFE1Qm2kJQ.mp4,"Online learning and how it affects different types of students, but we don't really have much research on how to deal with or looking at how schools deal with emergencies like this particularly."
1209,ZpFE1Qm2kJQ.mp4,"As I said, if it stretches out for a longer period of time this is really Uncharted Territory for most schools and Educators and faith is Uncharted to be know anything about what sort of residual impact that can come for a community when you have school clothes that and you're worried about things like the social spread of a virus."
1210,ZpFE1Qm2kJQ.mp4,"Well, we do have some analogue so that for example areas that have had natural disasters hurricanes tornadoes earthquakes things like that where they've had to close schools for a long time."
1211,ZpFE1Qm2kJQ.mp4,"You know, one of the things we learned is that most communities are very resilient and they figure out how to deal with catastrophes like this and in particular protect the interests of children and so what can parents do to prepare in case that their school does get closed."
1212,ZpFE1Qm2kJQ.mp4,"Well, you know first and foremost thinking about the technology needs and you know, whether students are going to have access to the technology."
1213,ZpFE1Qm2kJQ.mp4,"They need to be able to learn online because that's going to be the most the modality that most schools turn to is online learning things like that, you know smaller things like school supplies."
1214,ZpFE1Qm2kJQ.mp4,Can you get together with neighbors and get groups of children together in small groups to learn together even that can be an advantage over isolating every single student in their
1215,P4cw70RX6ZU.mp4,Hello there.
1216,P4cw70RX6ZU.mp4,My name is dr. Ram you Letty I'm the chief physician executive at Community Health Network want to give a brief update today about all the activity that's going on with covid-19.
1217,P4cw70RX6ZU.mp4,I know there's a lot of anxiety a lot of questions a lot of concerns and so want to kind of lay out what's going on and what we think we should be doing at this time.
1218,P4cw70RX6ZU.mp4,First and foremost is many of you baby.
1219,P4cw70RX6ZU.mp4,Maybe understand the who recently said his now pandemic.
1220,P4cw70RX6ZU.mp4,What a pandemic means is that there is a newHe's in the world.
1221,P4cw70RX6ZU.mp4,That's affecting the majority of countries and is continuing to be transmitted from person to person.
1222,P4cw70RX6ZU.mp4,One of the main reasons that the who has declared pandemic they stated is that they are very concerned that there's a significant amount of inaction in terms of what we're doing to deal with it.
1223,P4cw70RX6ZU.mp4,"So let me explain that because I know some of you are thinking well, what do you mean action sounds like we're going overboard The Other Extreme."
1224,P4cw70RX6ZU.mp4,So the biggest issue about about covid-19 is that this a new infection for which we have no treatment.
1225,P4cw70RX6ZU.mp4,"And so for those people that are most vulnerable when I mean people that are older than 60 if you get covid-19 infection, if you end up getting a pneumonia, we don't have any treatments for it."
1226,P4cw70RX6ZU.mp4,We don't have any antibiotics antiviral medications.
1227,P4cw70RX6ZU.mp4,All we could do is what's called supportive care and hope your body can fight the disease and recover from it.
1228,P4cw70RX6ZU.mp4,So that's the reason why it's so critical.
1229,P4cw70RX6ZU.mp4,"We already know studies from China and Japan if you're really below age 30 or below each 50, you're not going to get sick."
1230,P4cw70RX6ZU.mp4,"You're not going to die from it, and we already know that so it's not about it."
1231,P4cw70RX6ZU.mp4,Is it going to affect me but it's about me and everybody else are going to be affecting.
1232,P4cw70RX6ZU.mp4,So the reason we're trying to be so aggressive with this is to try to minimize.
1233,P4cw70RX6ZU.mp4,The number of people that are the elderly are going to get sick from it.
1234,P4cw70RX6ZU.mp4,And so the more aggressive we could be early on.
1235,P4cw70RX6ZU.mp4,Hopefully they'll be less patients that actually end up having problems with it at the end.
1236,P4cw70RX6ZU.mp4,So it's the transmission of the disease that we really want to minimize.
1237,P4cw70RX6ZU.mp4,"So people that have children or feeling otherwise healthy thinking well, what do I need to do the most important thing to do if you're having symptoms of flu like illness or cough or colder temperature?"
1238,P4cw70RX6ZU.mp4,"Is it is restrained yourself is seclude yourself, whether your child middle-aged any age so you don't spread the disease again all children and I'll most adults will get through just fine."
1239,P4cw70RX6ZU.mp4,But the most important you can do for society is to make sure the elderly don't get this infection or people have other significant health problems.
1240,P4cw70RX6ZU.mp4,That series will try and do this is that if we don't do this this will rapidly spread and we're going to have significant issues trying to take care of these people for as matter of as a point of fact in Italy right now.
1241,P4cw70RX6ZU.mp4,There's so many elderly that have been infected they're running.
1242,P4cw70RX6ZU.mp4,The ventilators to help with those people just in the city of Indianapolis yesterday.
1243,P4cw70RX6ZU.mp4,"There was a several hour meeting where all the Indianapolis clinicians came together and deciding if we can run the same situation when we run out of ventilators, how do we ration the ventilators what I'm hoping, you know, if we could at all possible is prevent this and prevent the spread of disease so we don't reach that point."
1244,P4cw70RX6ZU.mp4,So we're urging people is to use common sense.
1245,P4cw70RX6ZU.mp4,If you have symptoms stay inside keep yourself secluded until the symptoms go away and if we could do that early on in be very Rod about it that hopefully will limit the spread of the disease and the potential mortality from the disease.
1246,TSsfvGOPFy4.mp4,"Hi, I'm Katie Manning mental health coach intern with the hope and Healing Center in Houston, Texas."
1247,TSsfvGOPFy4.mp4,We're making a series of videos for those who are struggling with mental health who are forced to self quarantine right now due to covid-19 these videos include topics such as managing cycles and triggers during this time the importance of maintaining a routine and then this video is going to be all about managing anxiety related to the outbreak.
1248,TSsfvGOPFy4.mp4,It's very easy and understandable to get carried away with your thoughts.
1249,TSsfvGOPFy4.mp4,If you're stuck at home constantly watching the news cycle and gettingWorried and more and more anxious about covid-19 that really makes sense.
1250,TSsfvGOPFy4.mp4,"So this video is all about how to deal with those kind of feelings of anxiety that you may be experiencing one important reminder is to practice mindfulness mindfulness is simply being in the present moment taking it as it comes not clinging to the present moment not begging for the past or hoping for the future but just being comfortable in the present can be really hard to do but with practice you can get it and it can really help improve your mindset some examples of ways to practice mindfulness might beChin, or even just breathing in and out something that's really simple to start with is just feeling your body."
1251,TSsfvGOPFy4.mp4,"You feel your body in the chair you're sitting in now, if you're lying in bed watching this video on your phone."
1252,TSsfvGOPFy4.mp4,Do you feel your body and where it touches the bed different things like that?
1253,TSsfvGOPFy4.mp4,What Sensations does your body feel that can bring you back to the present moment and hope you get out of your head and it's really important to practice that during Times Like These another skill you can use as checking the facts is your brain running away without you and control are you thinking about everything that's going to happen?
1254,TSsfvGOPFy4.mp4,But hasn't happened yet that you don't know will happen while it's important to be prepared and make sure that you're on top of what may happen getting caught up in those thoughts about the future isn't always helpful.
1255,TSsfvGOPFy4.mp4,So there's a line between preparing and obsessing make sure that you're able to stay in the present as much as possible and check the facts that you actually know for a fact are happening right now.
1256,TSsfvGOPFy4.mp4,It's really understandable to be feeling anxious right now.
1257,TSsfvGOPFy4.mp4,And sometimes we might beat ourselves up for feeling anxious even though it's a very valid feeling to have so it's really important to practice self validation.
1258,TSsfvGOPFy4.mp4,That's basically just telling yourself that you feel anxious right now.
1259,TSsfvGOPFy4.mp4,And that's okay when you acknowledge that feeling it should help it go down and temper it a little bit and when you deny it and say don't feel so anxious.
1260,TSsfvGOPFy4.mp4,It's not helping that can make it go up by acknowledging and self validating your feelings of fear.
1261,TSsfvGOPFy4.mp4,Anxiety worry all totally.
1262,TSsfvGOPFy4.mp4,All it in this situation.
1263,TSsfvGOPFy4.mp4,You can really help manage them a little bit better.
1264,TSsfvGOPFy4.mp4,Now that we've gone over some skills.
1265,TSsfvGOPFy4.mp4,There's some resources that I would like to share with you in case you need them.
1266,TSsfvGOPFy4.mp4,So I'm going to be reading from a screen.
1267,TSsfvGOPFy4.mp4,"Bear with me one resource for you is to contact the samsa samhsa disaster distress helpline, and that number is 1-888-936-3264 five days a year crisis counseling and support to people experiencing emotional distress related to Natural."
1268,TSsfvGOPFy4.mp4,Natural or human cause disasters.
1269,TSsfvGOPFy4.mp4,So that's one resource that you can use.
1270,TSsfvGOPFy4.mp4,So with those skills and resources in mind.
1271,TSsfvGOPFy4.mp4,I hope that you feel a little bit better equipped to manage any anxiety experienced due to covid-19.
1272,TSsfvGOPFy4.mp4,It's a scary time but we can really get through this together and by being flexible by practicing really important mental health skills and by using the resources available remember all feelings pass and this is temporary and if you're feeling really anxious that will pass to and you'll feel something else soon.
1273,TSsfvGOPFy4.mp4,So keep That in mind and take care.
1274,ip7kKPNLN00.mp4,"So many surveys of the public found them hesitant to receive the covid vaccine when it's available many factors seem to be playing a role in this but one often cited reason is the operation warp speed in the development of a vaccine project very quickly compared to other projects in the past, but I've seen dr. Francis Collins mentioned that the speed has been much to do about getting the MRNA vaccination platform up and running because it's been something we've worked on since ours and murmurs."
1275,ip7kKPNLN00.mp4,I just thought what you wanted to say about that.Platform since most of the vaccines getting close to approval or of that same platform.
1276,ip7kKPNLN00.mp4,"Well, okay."
1277,ip7kKPNLN00.mp4,"So first of all, I have to say that with all due respect to my colleagues."
1278,ip7kKPNLN00.mp4,I've never liked the word warp speed.
1279,ip7kKPNLN00.mp4,It has a connotation of almost Reckless speed and it's not right and I think I you you kind of hinted at it Albert about saying that it's really the advances in platform technology that have allowed us to do things in a matter of months that usually takes literally year.
1280,ip7kKPNLN00.mp4,Is to do so I'll give you an example.
1281,ip7kKPNLN00.mp4,"There are six or seven platforms that are coming under the operation warp-speed umbrella, which means they're being facilitated developed and or helped out and financed by the federal government and there are three separate platforms involved in that, you know, one of them is Ali genetic platform exemplified by mRNA other vectors such as chimp add."
1282,ip7kKPNLN00.mp4,No human had no vsv measles and then there's the standard recombinant proteins.
1283,ip7kKPNLN00.mp4,So to just give you an example of why we feel that a the speed in no way compromises safety or even scientific integrity.
1284,ip7kKPNLN00.mp4,But it doesn't solve the problem that you mentioned that people perceive that we're going so fast that they may be reluctance to want to get vaccinated.
1285,ip7kKPNLN00.mp4,So the Chinese published the sequence of the saws coronavirus to on a public database on January the 10th.
1286,ip7kKPNLN00.mp4,I got my team together on the 11th and said we got to partner with moderna to develop this in an mRNA platform by the 15th.
1287,ip7kKPNLN00.mp4,That's five days.
1288,ip7kKPNLN00.mp4,We started doing it.
1289,ip7kKPNLN00.mp4,Sixty five days later.
1290,ip7kKPNLN00.mp4,We were in a Phase 1 trial.
1291,ip7kKPNLN00.mp4,"And six months later, we were in a phase three seven months later."
1292,ip7kKPNLN00.mp4,"When in Phase 3 trial that process normally would take a few years, but we didn't compromise anything."
1293,ip7kKPNLN00.mp4,"It isn't as if you know, we injected people and weren't worried about whether or not there's an adverse event or so."
1294,ip7kKPNLN00.mp4,Now what we have is we have three and very soon.
1295,ip7kKPNLN00.mp4,We will have four candidates in Phase 3 trial.
1296,ip7kKPNLN00.mp4,"One of the trials is having 30,000 people in it."
1297,ip7kKPNLN00.mp4,"Another is having 44,000 people in it."
1298,ip7kKPNLN00.mp4,And Jansen.
1299,ip7kKPNLN00.mp4,"J&J is going to have 60,000 people in it."
1300,ip7kKPNLN00.mp4,So there's going to be a lot of end there to look for efficacy.
1301,ip7kKPNLN00.mp4,But also a lot of people that are going to be observed for a considerable period of time for safety.
1302,ip7kKPNLN00.mp4,"I mean, I was just talking with the the person who's running the show for Jay and Jay Paul stoffels, you know telling me that there's going to be two year follow-up and then we're working with the moderna and the fisa people also long-term safety follow-up."
1303,ip7kKPNLN00.mp4,"So our challenge is going to be to reach out to the public particularly the vulnerable people that should be vaccinated and try and get them enrolled in a clinical trial because we really need What are What I Call comprable representativeness of the diversity in the population, we've got to get brown and black people."
1304,ip7kKPNLN00.mp4,"We gotta get with real-world African-American into the trial so that when we show that we have a safe and effective trial and a safe and effective product that we can say to the minority communities which are at higher risk, not only of infection but of the complications and say we've I've proven that we got a good vaccine but we've also proven it that it works in you and not just in white people."
1305,ip7kKPNLN00.mp4,That's the problem.
1306,ip7kKPNLN00.mp4,So the public perception is important as well.
1307,ip7kKPNLN00.mp4,It's totally critical totally critical.

1352,G4Ej9_-CHYI.mp4,T system Statewide including Dixie State University in Saint George will move to remote or online instruction for the rest of the semester.
1353,G4Ej9_-CHYI.mp4,I think when we consider the health and safety of our students our faculty staff and our community.
1354,G4Ej9_-CHYI.mp4,It's never an over reaction.
1355,G4Ej9_-CHYI.mp4,So I think we're being very cautious.
1356,G4Ej9_-CHYI.mp4,We have a lot of examples around the world of how they reacted and did not react.
1357,G4Ej9_-CHYI.mp4,And so I think that the governor's task force has been proactive and I think Dixie State University is being proactive and making sure that we're making wise decisions.
1358,G4Ej9_-CHYI.mp4,DSU students were surprised and concerned by the rapid change.
1359,G4Ej9_-CHYI.mp4,We heard the announcement.

1363,G4Ej9_-CHYI.mp4,Some students say they aren't prepared for online classes have to go out by like a computer that can like support all that.
1364,G4Ej9_-CHYI.mp4,"At get all my classes figure out how what they're doing just like all that stuff which they're kind of like acting on this week, but getting a computer getting like the proper technology is the hard part because your college student and I don't I don't like make a lot of money at my job initially students who must interact in Performance Based classes were concerned on how this might impact their final grade."
1365,G4Ej9_-CHYI.mp4,"Yeah, because I'm very bad at online classes."
1366,G4Ej9_-CHYI.mp4,That's one of the Things that really discourages me it's online classes because I like to interact with my teachers that one-on-one but I am very proud that I'm able to still have my internship and have that one-on-one.
1367,G4Ej9_-CHYI.mp4,They're not completely disconnecting everybody and so our campus will still be open they'll be able to come study in the library and the be able to go to the human performance center and blow off some steam.
1368,G4Ej9_-CHYI.mp4,"They just won't be meeting face-to-face and there will be a few Laboratories that we just can't not have class with clinicals and Reason certain art classes and so we're doing our best to accommodate those recommendations the announcement by the governor also recommends cancellation of large events over 100 people to limit Mass Gatherings two groups of 100 for the next two weeks beginning Monday, March 16th."
1369,G4Ej9_-CHYI.mp4,This includes Church Gatherings.

1378,_f4VKQ21sNw.mp4,"The findings are based on Trials involving some 6,000 patients across the UK the drug cuts the risk of death by a third for patients on ventilators and by 1/5 for those requiring oxygen are medical correspondent Fergus Walsh has the story for those laid Low by covid-19 for the very sickest hospital patients at last a drug that can tip the odds in their favor."
1379,_f4VKQ21sNw.mp4,"6,000 NHS covid patients were part of the trial and the results were so overwhelmingly positive."
1380,_f4VKQ21sNw.mp4,They were rushed out days after the study was completed.
1381,_f4VKQ21sNw.mp4,It found that dexamethasone saves one life for every eight patients on a ventilator and one life saved for every 25 patients on oxygen if it had been used from the outset of the pandemic.
1382,_f4VKQ21sNw.mp4,It's thought it could have saved four to five thousand lives in the UK.
1383,_f4VKQ21sNw.mp4,Catherine millbank from buckinghamshire spent 12 days on a ventilator with covid-19.
1384,_f4VKQ21sNw.mp4,She received dexamethasone after her husband Paul gave consent over the phone for her to take part in the trial When someone tells you that your wife's bright hanging on the edge of something that could go either way and you know that there's current proven drugs that are already in the in the medical industry already that are prescribed to people when you know I all around and there's a chance that might help you grab it without trying these things are not the researchers us.
1385,_f4VKQ21sNw.mp4,No one's going to get anywhere in finding out that the right drugs helped the pandemic that's happening and still going on as we're coming through it.

1403,_f4VKQ21sNw.mp4,"Now, it's frankly a bit of a surprise that the first drug proven to save lives with covid-19 is not some shiny high-tech experimental treatment that would cost thousands and only be available in rich countries."
1404,_f4VKQ21sNw.mp4,It's an old cheap as chips steroid that's used all over the World some caveat doesn't stop people getting coronavirus.
1405,_f4VKQ21sNw.mp4,It doesn't help early on in the disease.

1467,ykmjMWwrseE.mp4,They still put ads in front of you.
1468,ykmjMWwrseE.mp4,"Yes, then while you were trying to watch the film you would be constantly distracted people behind you talking."
1469,ykmjMWwrseE.mp4,A man to your left crunching on his over prize popcorn.
1470,ykmjMWwrseE.mp4,A moron three rows in front of me checking their phone a child.
1471,ykmjMWwrseE.mp4,Is this child even here?
1472,ykmjMWwrseE.mp4,I want to pick up that child on a squeezed his neck and I want to kick him like a football.
1473,ykmjMWwrseE.mp4,And then the worst thing is that after enduring the price the ads people distractions noise worst thing is at the end of it.
1474,ykmjMWwrseE.mp4,All the movie is absolute garbage.
1475,ykmjMWwrseE.mp4,"Oh God, Grandpa."
1476,ykmjMWwrseE.mp4,That sounds awful.
1477,ykmjMWwrseE.mp4,"It was my hope is if we fully recover from this madness, maybe movie theaters."
1478,ykmjMWwrseE.mp4,That's the one thing we all agree to Let Die.
1479,ykmjMWwrseE.mp4,"in GameStop fucking stop You know, I don't want to brag or anything, but my Apocalypse Hair is looking fan-fucking-tastic right now."
1480,ykmjMWwrseE.mp4,Look at this.
1481,OOJqHPfG7pA.mp4,At first you might think it's a cold and it could be but covid-19 could escalate.
1482,OOJqHPfG7pA.mp4,Here's what you need to know according to the World Health Organization China joint mission on covid-19.
1483,OOJqHPfG7pA.mp4,"As of February 20th, 80% of laboratory confirmed cases were mild to moderate 14% were severe and 6% were critical just to be clear a mild case of covid-19 is not like a mild cold the symptoms will still be pretty severe."
1484,OOJqHPfG7pA.mp4,fear anything less than needing oxygen puts you in this category severe cases do need supplemental oxygen and critical ones are defined by respiratory or multi-organ failure the symptoms treatments and timelines of having the disease vary depending on which category patients fall into so let's break down what having covid-19 looks like day-to-day for each level of severity it can take as few as two or as many as 14 days after being exposed to the I will coronavirus with the first symptom to develop.
1485,OOJqHPfG7pA.mp4,This is when it might feel like a cold or the common flu many patients develop fevers early on the World Health Organization China joint Mission.
1486,OOJqHPfG7pA.mp4,Saw that about eighty eight percent of people who had covid-19 had a fever another study out of China showed that while only 44 percent of patients had a fever on admission to a hospital 89% eventually developed one.
1487,OOJqHPfG7pA.mp4,But there have been some cases that led with gastrointestinal symptoms diarrhea nausea vomiting and or abdominal discomfort may appear a couple of days before respiratory symptoms.
1488,OOJqHPfG7pA.mp4,This isn't the norm though because covid-19 is a respiratory disease that means for most patients the virus will start and end with the lungs in the early days of infection the virus invades lung cells.
1489,OOJqHPfG7pA.mp4,Specifically this can damage the Cilia the hairlike projections that move around to keep Airways clear of mucus and debris when cells get infected.
1490,OOJqHPfG7pA.mp4,"They died and Shed off adding to the debris and hindering your body's ability to keep stuff out of the lungs and trachea the inflammation causes damage and damage causes more inflammation and this cycle could continue until there's no healthy tissue left and inflammation might explain why a dry cough is one of the most common symptoms same goes for shortness of breath and phlegm production other symptoms that can appear around this time our fatigue sore throat headache joint or muscle pain chills and a runny nose by day five patients with pre-existing conditions might find that they have trouble breathing and it usually takes about seven days for person to go to a hospital mild cases though usually clear up by this time, but those with moderate to critical cases will have Up to pneumonia which can range from non-life threatening to severe recovery time for these patients could be anywhere from a few days to weeks for some severe and critical cases though symptoms can escalate into acute respiratory distress syndrome."
1491,OOJqHPfG7pA.mp4,A RDS is an illness that happens when fluid builds up in the lungs inflammation triggers a flood of immune cells that are meant to Target the infection.
1492,OOJqHPfG7pA.mp4,"They're usually isolated to infected areas, but sometimes the ADI goes overboard which is when the immune cells start killing anything in their path including healthy cells AR DS is often fatal in critical cases."
1493,OOJqHPfG7pA.mp4,It can lead to respiratory failure requiring Advanced life support and this is most likely when patients head to the ICU a RDS treatment includes supplemental oxygen and mechanical ventilation.
1494,OOJqHPfG7pA.mp4,"The goal is to get more oxygen into the blood stream since the lungs can't When this treatment doesn't work, the lungs are basically two flooded to get any oxygen into your bloodstream."
1495,OOJqHPfG7pA.mp4,That's the cause of most covid-19 deaths and even when a patient survives this phase they could be left with permanent.
1496,OOJqHPfG7pA.mp4,Lung damage tsar's punched holes in some Infected people's lungs giving them a honeycomb effect.
1497,OOJqHPfG7pA.mp4,And these lesions have been seen in people affected by the novel coronavirus to early studies found that most people who died of the disease will do so Within 14 to 19 days and on average people who recover are released from the hospital after two and a half weeks.
1498,OOJqHPfG7pA.mp4,But with the most critical cases recovery could take months once a patient is in the recovery period it's possible that they could still be contagious.
1499,OOJqHPfG7pA.mp4,These people should work with their doctors and public health officials to determine when they're no longer a risk.
1500,OOJqHPfG7pA.mp4,As of now there is no vaccine for the virus.
1501,OOJqHPfG7pA.mp4,So the best way to avoid getting sick is to avoid being exposed covid-19 spreads easily from person to person through coughing and sneezing.
1502,OOJqHPfG7pA.mp4,"So wash your hands often and avoid close contact with people who are sick and clean and disinfect surfaces that you use daily covid-19 should be taken seriously, but most cases are survivable."
1503,OOJqHPfG7pA.mp4,So stay home.
1504,OOJqHPfG7pA.mp4,Stay clean and don't panic.
1505,DaF8TvBZYjE.mp4,Hi.
1506,DaF8TvBZYjE.mp4,Hi Charlie.
1507,DaF8TvBZYjE.mp4,It's Naomi from the Oxford vaccine group.
1508,DaF8TvBZYjE.mp4,And so with coronavirus cases.
1509,DaF8TvBZYjE.mp4,Hopefully in Retreat researchers working inside the NHS now have more time to learn as much as they can about the virus.
1510,DaF8TvBZYjE.mp4,The study will provide information about how antibodies levels to coronavirus change over time.
1511,DaF8TvBZYjE.mp4,The Oxford vaccine group part of the University of Oxford are on a home visit is part of a coronavirus study those that tests positive for covid antibodies.
1512,DaF8TvBZYjE.mp4,We will have been infected by the virus at some stage though.
1513,DaF8TvBZYjE.mp4,They may not have had any symptoms gunshots get UK researchers.
1514,DaF8TvBZYjE.mp4,Hope to find out what proportion of children in England have antibodies and eating and how that changes over time.
1515,DaF8TvBZYjE.mp4,So they get a sense of how many children are getting infected.
1516,DaF8TvBZYjE.mp4,We're lifting you're all done a bit concerned to start with 11 year old Charlie and his dad.
1517,DaF8TvBZYjE.mp4,"Chris are among the seven hundred and fifty families taking In the trial, hopefully if more people doing what Charlie was doing, it'll help get us all back to some normal life and get young people like themselves back at school makes you feel good because you're doing right and you're trying to helping save lives."
1518,DaF8TvBZYjE.mp4,The results of Charlie's test will be processed in this laboratory and Oxford.
1519,DaF8TvBZYjE.mp4,"The research has been funded by the National Institute for health research, which is carrying out over 50 studies into Coronavirus."
1520,DaF8TvBZYjE.mp4,So we have thousands of research nurses across all hospitals across the country and we what it means is we can mobilize those staff and their time is ring-fenced to do research and will this kind of this immunity these kind of antibody studies feed into our understanding will it feed into that is absolutely the kind of study that we needed to get these answers around antibodies and how those are our Transmissions happening particularly in children.
1521,DaF8TvBZYjE.mp4,The study has been running since February and they've just The first set of results through between three to four percent of children tested positive for covid-19 antibodies.
1522,DaF8TvBZYjE.mp4,"So may have had the virus the proportion is much higher in London, but fewer than ten percent of the children with detectable antibodies had any symptoms."
1523,DaF8TvBZYjE.mp4,"The research will also help to shed light on the role of children in spreading the virus know that it seems that unlike Illnesses like influenza, which are spread wonderfully by children are very good at spreading influence."
1524,DaF8TvBZYjE.mp4,Our children don't seem to be spreading the covid-19 virus to anything like the same extent and that's very different from most respect illnesses where it's usually the child that's brought the illness into the household.
1525,DaF8TvBZYjE.mp4,So there's something different about this that provides some reassurance when it comes to opening schools.
1526,DaF8TvBZYjE.mp4,"What we're hoping to do from here on is continue to take blood samples and then we'll be able to track increases in infection rates across different parts of the country and see for example if they coincide with reopening of school And see if that seems to result in an increasing number of infections in children, but could it be that these big antibody studies are under estimating the amount of immunity that children and adults have to this particular coronavirus minis reassuring that we're seeing higher antibody levels in London, whether it's been more disease that suggest there is definitely an association or correlation there, but it's possible."
1527,DaF8TvBZYjE.mp4,It is under estimating the the immunity that's out there antibodies are just one part of our immune system.
1528,DaF8TvBZYjE.mp4,And the measured partly because they're easy to test for in a lab.
1529,DaF8TvBZYjE.mp4,But our immunity is much more complex one area of growing interest is something called cellular immunity and this includes T cells which have a role in killing viruses.
1530,DaF8TvBZYjE.mp4,These cells might have a memory that help fight off future infections.
1531,DaF8TvBZYjE.mp4,One team in Sweden is trying to work out what role T cells play and think we might have more immunity than we realize our data is indicating that we that we can detect teaser responses in about 30% in individuals of the blood donors.
1532,DaF8TvBZYjE.mp4,They were testing back in May here in Stockholm in comparison to approximately 15% that had antibodies if that is going to be reflective on a very large population.
1533,DaF8TvBZYjE.mp4,We don't know that at least it indicates that we might underestimate the level of people that has some type of immunity against the virus.
1534,DaF8TvBZYjE.mp4,We've seen children.
1535,DaF8TvBZYjE.mp4,Don't get nearly as sick as adults.
1536,DaF8TvBZYjE.mp4,Why might that be a lot of these kids might have been fairly recently exposed to other similar type of coronavirus has and elderly people people then they might have some type of the protective response may be another theory is the virus interact differently with a child cells.
1537,DaF8TvBZYjE.mp4,"Well, it certainly striking is a pediatrician working on the water can say that we've just had no children with classic covid-19 disease."
1538,DaF8TvBZYjE.mp4,A lot seems to come down to receptacle the ace to receptor which the covid-19 virus binds to and children Express that at lower levels than adults do and that's so therefore that's there.
1539,DaF8TvBZYjE.mp4,It's potentially it's because the virus doesn't have anything to latch onto and children and can't go on to cause infection and disease is the team in Oxford are also interested in finding out more about the role of T-cells and I think that's one direction.
1540,DaF8TvBZYjE.mp4,We might be taking this study is to actually start to look for those white blood cells providing immunity.
1541,DaF8TvBZYjE.mp4,"It's coronavirus to see if more children have those those tests are trickier to do and and will be only be able to be done on a more limited number of children, but it's an important part of the question."
1542,DaF8TvBZYjE.mp4,The research being carried out here in the UK and across the world into this virus is crucial the more we know about how to diagnose treat and prevent it the sooner or lies can return to some sort of normal.
1543,6xeuAavcCGQ.mp4,The list of symptoms for covid-19 is growing.
1544,6xeuAavcCGQ.mp4,Thank you for staying with us.
1545,6xeuAavcCGQ.mp4,I'm Alan Campbell and I'm Glenda Lewis.
1546,6xeuAavcCGQ.mp4,The CDC is added several new signs that could indicate you may have the coronavirus our chief Health editor.
1547,6xeuAavcCGQ.mp4,Dr. Parthenon and he joins us now to tell us what they are good Friday afternoon to you doc.
1548,6xeuAavcCGQ.mp4,Hey Friday afternoon to Glendale.
1549,6xeuAavcCGQ.mp4,Yeah.
1550,6xeuAavcCGQ.mp4,"There's now at least eleven symptoms listed on the cdc's website Glen Allen and the most recent ones are added include congestion or runny nose, nausea or vomiting.And diarrhea and just to refresh everyone's memory."
1551,6xeuAavcCGQ.mp4,Remember the other symptoms on the list include fevers or chills cough shortness of breath or difficulty breathing fatigue muscle or body aches headache as well as new loss of taste or smell and sore throat.
1552,6xeuAavcCGQ.mp4,"So it's a it's a long list and unfortunately, it could continue to grow as we learn more about this this coronavirus."
1553,6xeuAavcCGQ.mp4,Yeah that list is definitely growing for sure doc.
1554,6xeuAavcCGQ.mp4,So a small CDC survey found almost all patients with covid-19 had one of Three key symptoms.
1555,6xeuAavcCGQ.mp4,What are they super important?
1556,6xeuAavcCGQ.mp4,Allen and a hundred sixty four people were surveyed and asked what their symptoms were when they had covid-19 and get this 96 percent of them said they had one of the following number one a fever cough or shortness of breath and 45 percent of them said they had all three of these symptoms.
1557,6xeuAavcCGQ.mp4,"Now, if you could break it down even further, which of those symptoms were the most common."
1558,6xeuAavcCGQ.mp4,Well Eighty-Four percent said that they had a cough and 80% of the fever as for sure.
1559,6xeuAavcCGQ.mp4,It's a breath breath get this 82% of people who are hospitalized.
1560,6xeuAavcCGQ.mp4,So they had it compared to just 38 percent of people surveyed who did not have to be hospitalized meaning they were probably not as severe.
1561,6xeuAavcCGQ.mp4,"And as many of those symptoms could be associated with flu or cold or stomach flu any of those things exactly, but the CDC."
1562,6xeuAavcCGQ.mp4,Yeah scary recently adding some emergency warning signs.
1563,6xeuAavcCGQ.mp4,"So, can you tell us what those are?"
1564,6xeuAavcCGQ.mp4,"Yeah, in addition to all those those symptoms and signs I talked about these are the emergency warning signs and they say this is what to look out for trouble breathing persistent pain or pressure in the chest new episode of new areas."
1565,6xeuAavcCGQ.mp4,I knew times that you're having confusion inability to Wake or stay awake and then a bluish bluish lips or face.
1566,6xeuAavcCGQ.mp4,All those are concerning.
1567,6xeuAavcCGQ.mp4,And so that this doesn't cover everything that people can have we know that some people actually have trouble speaking or problems with their site or maybe you feel foggy or not.
1568,6xeuAavcCGQ.mp4,You're not thinking quite a sharply as you normally would the main point here is that you seek out medical help for any symptoms you feel that severe or worrying too?
1569,6xeuAavcCGQ.mp4,"Because if you wait, it could be too late."
1570,6xeuAavcCGQ.mp4,You want to get medical help quickly?
1571,6xeuAavcCGQ.mp4,Yeah.
1572,6xeuAavcCGQ.mp4,It's so important to go see the doctor right away.
1573,6xeuAavcCGQ.mp4,"So Turn Andy, you know we're hearing about some very scary complications like blood clots and amputations."
1574,6xeuAavcCGQ.mp4,Are these common so Alan complications can develop and if it's a lie for some people it can literally cost him an arm or a leg.
1575,6xeuAavcCGQ.mp4,For example amputations can happen due to lack of oxygen lack of blood flow and problems with blood pressure.
1576,6xeuAavcCGQ.mp4,"And as you mentioned some people having strokes and other issues with blood clots, even young folks and thankfully these serious complications is not very common, but it just tells us the importance of continuing to Stay vigilant listening to stated National officials, you know Again cover up your face right get a face mask social distance sanitize areas that are common."
1577,6xeuAavcCGQ.mp4,It's so important it's basic but it's so important we can prevent this disease and and do what many other countries around the world have which is control it.
1578,6xeuAavcCGQ.mp4,We can do it here at the United States as well.
1579,6xeuAavcCGQ.mp4,Thank you for that.
1580,6xeuAavcCGQ.mp4,Dr. Nandi my pleasure and don't forget you can watch dr. Nandi on Sunday at 1 p.m.
1581,6xeuAavcCGQ.mp4,Right here on seven this week.
1582,6xeuAavcCGQ.mp4,Dr. Nancy takes a closer.
1583,6xeuAavcCGQ.mp4,Look at whether all men should be screened for prostate.
1584,6xeuAavcCGQ.mp4,State cancer
1585,pxI82xaEZDA.mp4,Chris medical minute sponsored by a Vera as we enter cold and flu season doctors are prepared to screen and test patients for many illnesses medical minute reporter Beth Warden talked with a Vera pediatrician.
1586,pxI82xaEZDA.mp4,Dr. Natalie Hutton to discuss covid-19 and RSV and how to tell the difference between them.
1587,pxI82xaEZDA.mp4,It could be a little bit confusing now that we're worried about the coronavirus.
1588,pxI82xaEZDA.mp4,What is the difference between symptoms with RSV?
1589,pxI82xaEZDA.mp4,And And covid-19.
1590,pxI82xaEZDA.mp4,They both can cause cough and congestion and in a low-grade fever covid is also associated with more of a longer array of symptoms.
1591,pxI82xaEZDA.mp4,It's such as vomiting diarrhea loss of taste things of that sort.
1592,pxI82xaEZDA.mp4,There is a vaccine for RSV called synergists.
1593,pxI82xaEZDA.mp4,It is only approved for very premature babies.
1594,pxI82xaEZDA.mp4,So it is not used for term babies or other.
1595,pxI82xaEZDA.mp4,"How will you be able to determine if a child comes in if it's covid or if it's Aras be great question, there is really it's you cannot tell the difference."
1596,pxI82xaEZDA.mp4,"So in order to know that, you know, we would test we could test for to determine if it's RSA versus covid or non non covid upper respiratory infection."
1597,pxI82xaEZDA.mp4,And if it turns out that a child is diagnosed with RSV.
1598,pxI82xaEZDA.mp4,What are the treatment options?
1599,pxI82xaEZDA.mp4,So we give Talent?
1600,pxI82xaEZDA.mp4,"or Motrin for fever and sure parents and patients drink lots of fluids rest if they have worsening respiratory symptoms, then they come and see us and we would manage that with other other things such as breathing treatments oxygen if need be it with admission to the hospital, but those that's it that's rare that doesn't happen often children are being hospitalized for covid, but it's extremely rare in comparison to There's eight out of a hundred thousand that are being on average that are being hospitalized."
1601,pxI82xaEZDA.mp4,"So I guess I wanted to put that out there for parents to understand to have caution, but not be so scared that you wouldn't go to the doctor to be seen."
1602,pxI82xaEZDA.mp4,For more information on finding health care for your family go to a Vera dot o-- r-- g-- we'll be right back.
1603,RK2IfGPSqO0.mp4,"If you're worried about the economic toll of the coronavirus crisis, you're not alone."
1604,RK2IfGPSqO0.mp4,It's scary.
1605,RK2IfGPSqO0.mp4,There is no clear forecast and each country's experience will be different.
1606,RK2IfGPSqO0.mp4,Here's what we do know a steady flow of money Goods services and the people to make them flow is essential to a healthy economy.
1607,RK2IfGPSqO0.mp4,And that flow is severed right now by life-saving stay-at-home orders.
1608,RK2IfGPSqO0.mp4,Recession is inevitable.
1609,RK2IfGPSqO0.mp4,But what kind of recession it will be and what recovery might look like is still unclear To help imagine what could happen authors from Boston Consulting Group point out that recessions and their recoveries come in various shapes.
1610,RK2IfGPSqO0.mp4,These are determined by how hard a crisis hits the supply side of an economy.
1611,RK2IfGPSqO0.mp4,That's an economy's inputs Capital like Machinery Factory software labor or workers plus productivity or how we use labor and capital productively.
1612,RK2IfGPSqO0.mp4,The heart of the supply side is hit the more credit is interrupted meaning less money is injected in the form of loans to businesses and individuals to fuel investment and the more difficult it is for productivity to recover from best to worst.
1613,RK2IfGPSqO0.mp4,We have v u and L recession shock shapes.
1614,RK2IfGPSqO0.mp4,The V shape is a one-time dip if credit can continue to flow productivity and labor are less affected.
1615,RK2IfGPSqO0.mp4,"You can see that growth dips, but recovers to its pre-crisis level and rate."
1616,RK2IfGPSqO0.mp4,Do you shape is much more costly credit flow is disrupted and growth drops precipitously.
1617,RK2IfGPSqO0.mp4,"Never rebounding to its pre-crisis path the rate of growth recovers, see how the slopes are the same but a large gap between the Old and New Paths represents one off damage to the economy supply-side."
1618,RK2IfGPSqO0.mp4,The L shape is the worst credit is severely disrupted not once but perpetually and there is very little new investment this economy never recovers its prior output path and the rate of growth also decline.
1619,RK2IfGPSqO0.mp4,Owns the crisis leaves permanent structural damage to the economy supply-side these examples represent crises that started in the financial sector disrupting credit flow and thus Capital Growth.
1620,RK2IfGPSqO0.mp4,We have some off-the-shelf policies for dealing with these.
1621,RK2IfGPSqO0.mp4,"However, we are now in Uncharted Territory with a double risk of a financial System Shock and an epic freeze of the real economy."
1622,RK2IfGPSqO0.mp4,The households firms and government that deliver real physical goods and services countries have no existing playbook for dealing with Double shock months of necessary social distancing raises the risk of both types of problems which can feed off each other in dangerous ways.
1623,RK2IfGPSqO0.mp4,"For example, a prolonged crisis can drive up real economy bankruptcies of everyday people and firms making it harder for financial systems to manage and a financial system crisis would starve the real economy of credit which could cripple investment and ultimately growth in this combined crisis capital does not grow pushing the economy towards a u shape."
1624,RK2IfGPSqO0.mp4,Not good.
1625,RK2IfGPSqO0.mp4,"However, we can head off a URL shaped recovery and lessen the intensity of the crisis how primarily Innovation on the medical side vaccines treatments and capacity Innovations are needed to save lives and end the economic damage caused by social distancing on the economic side in addition to a vigorous and efficient policy response."
1626,RK2IfGPSqO0.mp4,We will need policy Innovations.
1627,RK2IfGPSqO0.mp4,For example in the US the two trillion dollar stimulus bill is just a start we will Innovative ways to deliver that money to those who need it since never before have policymakers had to help such large numbers of firms and households.
1628,RK2IfGPSqO0.mp4,"For example, the so-called Discount Windows that allow unlimited access to funding for the financial sector could be replicated for households and firms in the real economy so that they can stay afloat."
1629,RK2IfGPSqO0.mp4,Zero interest Bridge loans to households and firms a moratorium on mortgage payments for residential and Commercial borrowers.
1630,RK2IfGPSqO0.mp4,These are potential solutions that could help make a real difference.
1631,RK2IfGPSqO0.mp4,The economic goal is to keep our shock shape closer to a V and further away from a you or an L Speedy well-executed medical and policy Innovations are our best.
1632,RK2IfGPSqO0.mp4,Hope to save the most lives and avoid permanent economic damage.
1633,VAC3qTSipNA.mp4,"Most people don't like showing off their feet, but Sadie Dohan knew something was off or very itchy almost like bug bites doctors in the US and Canada were recently sent an alert lookout for cases of kids with purple swollen toes."
1634,VAC3qTSipNA.mp4,Sometimes they're hot and painful sometimes the children are otherwise.
1635,VAC3qTSipNA.mp4,"Well, the condition has been dubbed covid toes and doctors are being told to test patients for the virus the skin findings themselves.A self resolving phenomenon and shouldn't be a cause for concern but it is important that Physicians be aware that this condition may be a sign of covid-19 children pick up plenty of germs."
1636,VAC3qTSipNA.mp4,The coronavirus is no exception.
1637,VAC3qTSipNA.mp4,But in some ways this virus is different.
1638,VAC3qTSipNA.mp4,So it is acting differently than most other typical illnesses such as influenza.
1639,VAC3qTSipNA.mp4,It hasn't been really making children.
1640,VAC3qTSipNA.mp4,Very sick Chinese researchers found about 6 percent of children infected with covid-19 became severely or critically ill in adults.
1641,VAC3qTSipNA.mp4,It's nearly 20 percent doctors aren't sure why but many suspect children might have a different immune response with this virus being novel The Novel coronavirus.
1642,VAC3qTSipNA.mp4,"We're learning new things every single day in an effort to get ahead of this disease pediatricians are sharing information globally including reports of a rare, but severe inflammatory disease that's apparently being seen in some children in Europe but Canadian, After say those reports are not confirmed."
1643,VAC3qTSipNA.mp4,We don't know how many cases there are we don't know if it's really an increase from what you would expect and we certainly don't know if it's linked to covid in serious cases of covid-19 doctors say children do have the same symptoms as adults if a child has high fever coughing and trouble breathing.
1644,VAC3qTSipNA.mp4,"They should be rushed to emergency Christine Barracks CBC News, Toronto."
1645,VAC3qTSipNA.mp4,"Okay, so we have dr. Dina cool of joining us just to chat a little bit more about this and dr. Kulik."
1646,VAC3qTSipNA.mp4,How compelling is the evidence of a link between covid-19 and covid Toes nursery rhyme young Link.
1647,VAC3qTSipNA.mp4,We are seeing more and more cases being reported around the world.
1648,VAC3qTSipNA.mp4,"Some people have confirmed covid infection other people are still waiting for their test results, but around the world."
1649,VAC3qTSipNA.mp4,We're seeing some kids with this crash and covid affection.
1650,VAC3qTSipNA.mp4,But and so given then that What would you advise to parents who if they see covid Toes or something similar and say no other symptoms what ought they to do.
1651,VAC3qTSipNA.mp4,So in this case because of this different kind of rash.
1652,VAC3qTSipNA.mp4,"We are actually recommending that these kids get tested for covid many other symptoms like coughing or runny nose or fever or vomiting most of our saying stay home stay away from people that are at higher risk of severe covid infection like the elderly and people with chronic health concerns, but because we're monitoring with this rash so carefully we're actually suggested to families that if your child has this rash, even if otherwise they're asymptomatic and well, they should actually be tested for code."
1653,VAC3qTSipNA.mp4,"Okay, dr. Kovac."
1654,VAC3qTSipNA.mp4,Thanks for your time.
1655,VAC3qTSipNA.mp4,You're welcome.
1656,HYDUZW_xgzE.mp4,How much Clarity do we have over standards and safeguards when it comes to these Chinese Developers?
1657,HYDUZW_xgzE.mp4,"Well, we have a little bit less information from the Chinese side than we do from from some of these Western developers."
1658,HYDUZW_xgzE.mp4,"Typically, you don't get a huge amount of information from vaccine developers."
1659,HYDUZW_xgzE.mp4,"But this time is different because of the huge amount of scrutiny and anticipation when it comes to vaccine development for covid-19 companies like moderna like AstraZeneca, they're releasing a lot more than they normally would when it comes to A progress and some of the pitfalls that they're having when it comes to their clinical trials."
1660,HYDUZW_xgzE.mp4,"We haven't heard anything like this from the Chinese developers and they have been consistently saying that they haven't had any serious adverse reactions among the volunteers in their clinical trials, which a number of the experts that International vaccine experts that we spoke to say it's statistically impossible."
1661,HYDUZW_xgzE.mp4,So what are the kind of the bigger concerns here rides you want to be first?
1662,HYDUZW_xgzE.mp4,You also want to be safe and effective.
1663,HYDUZW_xgzE.mp4,"So, is there a sense that China's sort of getting the steps?"
1664,HYDUZW_xgzE.mp4,Maybe I'll getting a little bit ahead of itself.
1665,HYDUZW_xgzE.mp4,Terry there's a fitted concerned that not only are they doing these quite wide-ranging and large clinical trials.
1666,HYDUZW_xgzE.mp4,"We've got Chinese developers testing everywhere from Indonesia to Pakistan and many of them in Phase 3, but they're also making quite a big use of the emergency use authorization that to in particular of the Chinese companies developing covid vaccines have and that means that a wide range of people not just Frontline workers, like medical staff or purport workers are getting these vaccines that haven't been approved yet, but also workers at state-run Enterprises who are traveling overseas in China also able to get these vaccines that are yet to be proven effective and yet to be proven so so that's raising a lot of concern because that number amounts to in the hundreds of thousands of people with very little monitoring that we can tell of the reactions or even the effectiveness of the vaccine in those people."
1667,HYDUZW_xgzE.mp4,So how close are we told that we are to a potential Chinese vaccine?
1668,HYDUZW_xgzE.mp4,"Well, I mean they also being on that side."
1669,HYDUZW_xgzE.mp4,"I mean we hear a lot more from the Western developers about when they're going to release interim data and the next month or so, for example, when they're going to update the market we have heard that if they beat this year that we get some sort of indication on how pastry or final stage trials are going for some of these developers."
1670,HYDUZW_xgzE.mp4,"But otherwise, we've been quite quiet potentially the fact that they are rolling in Quite widely in emergency used to show that they while they don't have concerned perhaps about the safety side."
1671,HYDUZW_xgzE.mp4,They are still testing efficacy with to the end of the day.
1672,HYDUZW_xgzE.mp4,It's what everybody is waiting for.
1673,HYDUZW_xgzE.mp4,And what what sort of difference in terms of risk and being able to monitor people that qualify under the emergency use program to the data that's collected and disclosed to Regulators under clinical trials.
1674,HYDUZW_xgzE.mp4,"Well, I mean it's like night and day right you have clinical trials to run by independent companies separate to the vaccine developer who are monitoring the conditions under which people volunteers are given the vaccine."
1675,HYDUZW_xgzE.mp4,They're they're they're assembling a very wide in many cases group of volunteers to make sure that they're testing the vaccine and a variety of people when you're just giving it.
1676,HYDUZW_xgzE.mp4,Not in an emergency you as far as we can we can tell from the people that we've spoken to.
1677,HYDUZW_xgzE.mp4,"There's very little follow up with those people those on whether they you know, still get the virus after getting the vaccine."
1678,HYDUZW_xgzE.mp4,"So, you know, that means it's not effective or whether they are getting any kind of reactions whether that looks low grade Adverse Events that you potentially do get with with most vaccines like, you know, a low fever or a little rash at the injection site or whether they're seeing something much more."
1679,HYDUZW_xgzE.mp4,More serious and potentially not not linking it to the vaccine.
1680,HYDUZW_xgzE.mp4,So that's just a bit of a black hole there in terms of understanding whether this vaccine is having an impact on people that we've noticed in our research.
1681,GYKivQjEXCI.mp4,Someone who studied misinformation in public health for a few years the teams that I work with in research Bodywork quite seamlessly across disciplines from physics and computer science through Communications psychology and public health.
1682,GYKivQjEXCI.mp4,But thing I valued most about the conference was the ability to cross the Divide from research to practice to learn from experiences that people have had promoting evidence in debunking misinformation and the real world and is very different online and offline environments.
1683,GYKivQjEXCI.mp4,I was really captivated by this idea that if we really want this big community of transdisciplinary research some practitioners to be able to truly synthesize what we know in a robust way.
1684,GYKivQjEXCI.mp4,We need open and curated repositories with examples of misinformation grouped and classified according to characteristics perhaps using the taxonomy that Clearwater suggested it would also make sense to do something similar for the different classes of interventions designed to prevent or mitigate misinformation.
1685,GYKivQjEXCI.mp4,I'm really looking forward to seeing where this will go and I think it can go a long way to preventing what happens with misinformation and harmful behaviors and policies and Future.

1701,LCasL-iLUOQ.mp4,We have some questions here from our viewers where we want to start here.
1702,LCasL-iLUOQ.mp4,Is it true that in general covid-19 death rates have actually gone down.
1703,LCasL-iLUOQ.mp4,Okay lately depends what window of time you look at and we're at the overall curve you are looking right now according to the Department of HHS.
1704,LCasL-iLUOQ.mp4,"We're actually seeing those numbers go up, but if you compare it to let's say February March April."
1705,LCasL-iLUOQ.mp4,"Yes, we have made incredible progress the learning curve for the critical care of patients with severe."
1706,LCasL-iLUOQ.mp4,And critical covid-19 has been very rapid on the part of intensive is critical care specialist all of the nurse anesthetist Etc.
1707,LCasL-iLUOQ.mp4,So we are learning how to treat these patients better.
1708,LCasL-iLUOQ.mp4,But right now our death rate is climbing.
1709,LCasL-iLUOQ.mp4,"All right, and our final question."
1710,LCasL-iLUOQ.mp4,I've heard rumors cannabis may help treat covid-19 complications.
1711,LCasL-iLUOQ.mp4,Is there any truth to that?
1712,LCasL-iLUOQ.mp4,So I am a big believer in the therapeutic modality of cannabis.
1713,LCasL-iLUOQ.mp4,I think we're just at its infancy right now in terms of Being it and understanding its benefits as well as its risks.
1714,LCasL-iLUOQ.mp4,"The short answer is based on existing data, there's potential help but there's also potential harm overall cannabis users can be at increased risk of covid, but there is a drug that actually was approved by the FDA to go into phase one clinical trials by the end of this year."
1715,LCasL-iLUOQ.mp4,It's a synthetic cannabinoid and it is being targeted to be studied in patients with that so-called cytokine storm storm to reduce the inflammation.
1716,LCasL-iLUOQ.mp4,"So not yet ready for prime time, but I do believe there."
1717,LCasL-iLUOQ.mp4,"There may be some future in this, but it is an area of intense research."
1718,LCasL-iLUOQ.mp4,All right Doug.
1719,LCasL-iLUOQ.mp4,"Thank you so much, and thank you all for your questions."

1757,v5Asgg1Orzc.mp4,millions of people around the world have recovered from covid-19 and one of their primary concerns is whether they can get reinfected by the novel coronavirus have they developed immunity and if so for how long In a recent development researchers in Hong Kong reported the first confirmed case of covid-19 reinfection a 33 year old Chinese man was found carrying the disease four and a half months after recovering from the first infection similar cases of reinfection were reported in close succession in Belgium and Netherlands and in the United States a case of Presumed reinfection was reported.
1758,v5Asgg1Orzc.mp4,"Showing that the immunity developed after Contracting the disease once mean not be long lasting Indian States like Telangana, Karnataka Gujarat Punjab and Maharashtra have also reported cases of reinfection."
1759,v5Asgg1Orzc.mp4,The CDC had previously acknowledged that there had been instances in which people had tested positive again after having recovered from the disease once but said that it could be because of persistent virus shedding.
1760,v5Asgg1Orzc.mp4,Recovered patients can have low levels of virus for up to three months after the infection and though it is no longer enough to make the person sick or transmit the disease to others.
1761,v5Asgg1Orzc.mp4,It can get detected in diagnostic tests.
1762,v5Asgg1Orzc.mp4,Scientists have confirmed that the case of the 33 year old Chinese person is indeed one of reinfection and not of traces of virus from the previous infection getting detected again.
1763,v5Asgg1Orzc.mp4,"In fact, the case for reinfection is not being made on the basis of results of a diagnostic test."
1764,v5Asgg1Orzc.mp4,On comparing genome sequences extracted from viral specimens collected from the same patient during the first and second infections.
1765,v5Asgg1Orzc.mp4,It was found that the person had been infected with two different variants of the novel coronavirus viruses mutate with time developing small differences in their genetic makeup this enables researchers to trace the origins of the infection and the possible routes through which it has been circulating in this.
1766,v5Asgg1Orzc.mp4,The variant of virus extracted the second time resembled closely to those in circulation in Europe in July and August that could possibly mean that he had been reinfected when he travelled to Spain after recovering from the first infection.
1767,v5Asgg1Orzc.mp4,He had tested positive while being screened at the airport on his return.
1768,v5Asgg1Orzc.mp4,In the case of the reinfection in the US to researchers in Nevada found that the patient had been infected with two different strains of the virus during his two infection Cycles.
1769,v5Asgg1Orzc.mp4,"The fact that g infection has been confirmed has not come as a surprise to scientists other viruses including those from the coronavirus family, especially those that cause respiratory illnesses."
1770,v5Asgg1Orzc.mp4,In fact a large number of people every year and those who have been infected ones are not considered immune from them.
1771,v5Asgg1Orzc.mp4,There is no reason to believe why Cyrus you've eaten the virus that causes covid-19 disease would be any different but these First cases of reinfection do not mean that everyone is equally susceptible to reinfection the Hong Kong researchers noted that in the Chinese patient with disease was found to be milder and reinfection as compared to the first infection.
1772,v5Asgg1Orzc.mp4,The cause of the infection would happen only from the different variants of the virus that are currently in circulation and most of the vaccines being developed are meant to provide protection against all the variants of the virus.
1773,v5Asgg1Orzc.mp4,There is no reason to question the effectiveness of these vaccines.
1774,pVwxUVlQ7YM.mp4,I grew up on the block with George Voight was murdered.
1775,pVwxUVlQ7YM.mp4,It connects historically to suffering of a people to suffer enough communities Health Centers have been at the front line of that suffering the way that started was in the 60s.
1776,pVwxUVlQ7YM.mp4,What if this new Clinic would offer all of the medical services in one place hire people from the community so that they then had a job and therefore that clinic became an economic driver and community health centers in general started.
1777,pVwxUVlQ7YM.mp4,"Opening throughout the US and now they are 1,200 beautiful Summers with over 11,000 location surveying."
1778,pVwxUVlQ7YM.mp4,Totally.
1779,pVwxUVlQ7YM.mp4,These are the hardest working people in our areas.
1780,pVwxUVlQ7YM.mp4,"We have multiple jobs, except everyone regardless of ability to pay and our community that we serve is also the staff that we have."
1781,pVwxUVlQ7YM.mp4,"We have over 50 percent of our staff are from the community that work in our sites and their the beans for patients because they really provide the services linguistically as well as culturally that the patient's understand and need that we did not expect Global and this is where our philanthropy or community health centers is something that we didn't have the burial for the Partnerships to do we had initially only 20 test kits available for our 25,000 patients that we see even though the County of Los Angeles has At test sites opening they were all drive-through test sites."
1782,pVwxUVlQ7YM.mp4,Most of our patients either take buses a walk within the community area.
1783,pVwxUVlQ7YM.mp4,And so we decided to do it ourselves and to this day.
1784,pVwxUVlQ7YM.mp4,"We've probably given a little over 2,000 tests to our patients."
1785,pVwxUVlQ7YM.mp4,Everything across Center is struggling right now with what's going to happen.
1786,pVwxUVlQ7YM.mp4,"Hey, we can't do it thunders Partners globally."

1790,pVwxUVlQ7YM.mp4,We'll make it work every dollar invested in Health Center results in five dollars in the local economy.
1791,pVwxUVlQ7YM.mp4,I like to think of human health centers as being leaders in this creative human centered.
1792,pVwxUVlQ7YM.mp4,"Design approach to healthcare where we integrate not only dental services but Medical Services Pharmacy Services, we integrate Chiropractic Services."
1793,pVwxUVlQ7YM.mp4,"We integrate the social worker in public health services all in support of the patient and we're not just thinking about what they need clinically, but what they need in terms of their social determinants of health or social influences help and how we can wrap around these the whole person in order to impact Health Care outcomes of the entire community."
1794,pVwxUVlQ7YM.mp4,"The chances are high if we just thing you need is to realize that every epidemic Isabel, even if it's happening everywhere."
1795,pVwxUVlQ7YM.mp4,You need a local response as we all know covid-19 is not going to go away tomorrow.
1796,pVwxUVlQ7YM.mp4,In fact might be with us for at least another year or two.
1797,pVwxUVlQ7YM.mp4,We have the flu season coming.
1798,pVwxUVlQ7YM.mp4,"There are a lot of issues that we have to think about how hospitals and acute care is important, but I think the focus and maybe covid-19."
1799,pVwxUVlQ7YM.mp4,"Ian is going to help us do this is really the focus should be on prevention and more public health support because this is a what makes our society healthier and attacks the chronic diseases that we end up having what we don't have good medical care that's accessible and affordable healthcare for everyone is important quality affordable accessible health care, and we do our best to try to make sure that that is accomplished."

1841,qb7shu_sdQ0.mp4,"If you are at higher risk for severe illness from covid-19 take actions to reduce your risk of getting sick have supplies on hand take everyday precautions, like washing your hands with soap and water avoid travel stay home as much as possible avoid all Cruz a non-essential travel and have a plan for if you get sick."
1842,qb7shu_sdQ0.mp4,"If you have symptoms, like fever cough and shortness of breath call your doctor call 911 if you have emergency warning signs, including difficulty breathing persistent pain or pressure in the chest."

1846,tcsWEhm0Bcs.mp4,"In this video, we'll be discussing about the corner virus the corner virus involves group of viruses from corner Verity family."
1847,tcsWEhm0Bcs.mp4,But here in this video we are more focused towards the new type of corner virus that has been hitting the world now mostly their China the World Health Organization has specified a name for the disease called the corner virus disease or simply C. OV ID covid-19 19 designates the year formerly the corner virus which caused the covid-19 was named 2019 novel coronavirus or 2019 and CEO.
1848,tcsWEhm0Bcs.mp4,But later on optional name was designated for it and it was Saul COV to SAR SC OV to just like we had salt COV in China between 2002 and 2004.
1849,tcsWEhm0Bcs.mp4,"This is the same beta Corner virus, but with different surface protein structures this or Co V 2 is opposed to send single strand RNA virus."
1850,tcsWEhm0Bcs.mp4,It's linear with helical capsid The Source your V2 is from corner.
1851,tcsWEhm0Bcs.mp4,"Where a defendant Family, which is having peplow Moore's or Spike proteins on its surface as shown in the diagram."
1852,tcsWEhm0Bcs.mp4,It's despite proteins which airs in the receptor binding with the host cell furthermore.
1853,tcsWEhm0Bcs.mp4,It should be noted that this is not the first occurrence of corner virus since we had various Corners outbreaks in the past in humans in human Corner virus history.
1854,tcsWEhm0Bcs.mp4,We see there was human carnivores 2290 called the SUV 2290.
1855,tcsWEhm0Bcs.mp4,The second is the human carnivores oc4 3/3 thus our CEO.
1856,tcsWEhm0Bcs.mp4,We fourth one is the SUV and L6 3 the animal stands for Netherlands where it was first reported.
1857,tcsWEhm0Bcs.mp4,Fourth one is the H Tau 1 chord.
1858,tcsWEhm0Bcs.mp4,No virus originated from Hong Kong.
1859,tcsWEhm0Bcs.mp4,"The fifth one is the mer small COV the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, then we have the another lethal strand from 2019, which is termed as sore COV to severe acute respiratory syndrome."
1860,tcsWEhm0Bcs.mp4,To that has been reported in 2019 from Wuhan China.
1861,tcsWEhm0Bcs.mp4,The 22-9 is the alpha core.
1862,tcsWEhm0Bcs.mp4,No virus OC 43 is the beta core.
1863,tcsWEhm0Bcs.mp4,No virus source govt is also the beta called No virus and the 63 is Alpha coronavirus.
1864,tcsWEhm0Bcs.mp4,"Whereas the HQ u 1 and MERS or both beta Corner virus and the lethal of all the corner viruses is the source govt to formally known as 2090 novel coronavirus, which is also the beta Corner virus and we know it has been originated."
1865,tcsWEhm0Bcs.mp4,Did vahan?
1866,tcsWEhm0Bcs.mp4,Moving further we see the present Corner virus happiness to threaten the world at a large scale and it's one of the new strands from corn already family.
1867,tcsWEhm0Bcs.mp4,It is believed that there is a cross species jump like we have already seen the cross-species jump back in 2002.
1868,tcsWEhm0Bcs.mp4,"The Horseshoe bats harboring virus strains jumper to humans in 2002, and we got the source into zone two that way."
1869,tcsWEhm0Bcs.mp4,Looking at the novel coronavirus it has been named so because the novel describes its features no will means new not resembling something Formerly Known and why it's different.
1870,tcsWEhm0Bcs.mp4,It's because of the surface protein called with Spike protein.
1871,tcsWEhm0Bcs.mp4,The virus uses it to bind to a cell receptor thus gaining entry into the host cell.
1872,tcsWEhm0Bcs.mp4,So it is this Spike protein which shows enormous diversity in source.
1873,tcsWEhm0Bcs.mp4,Govt to Spike protein Ops or COV do that's novel coronavirus is different from Spike Protein that's found in Source govt reported from 2002 and due to this property the virus proved to be very effective and lethal virus since no previous vaccine works for them.
1874,tcsWEhm0Bcs.mp4,And one of the only development still now a novel coronavirus is from the University of Texas at Austin under Professor.
1875,tcsWEhm0Bcs.mp4,Jason MccLellan.
1876,tcsWEhm0Bcs.mp4,They developed 3D atomic scale map of salt Co V 2 in which they have rendered the molecular structure of Spike protein from sore Co V 2 as shown in the diagram and this new research will definitely support for the generation of vaccine for novel coronavirus.
1877,tcsWEhm0Bcs.mp4,And as of now 26th Feb 20 Modern a biotech company has just released its first vaccines for Corner virus.
1878,tcsWEhm0Bcs.mp4,These vaccines are called mRNA 1273.
1879,tcsWEhm0Bcs.mp4,And these first vaccines for Corner virus have been sent to National Institute of allergy and infectious diseases for testing.
1880,tcsWEhm0Bcs.mp4,So we hope this vaccine will work against the corner virus.
1881,tcsWEhm0Bcs.mp4,So till this date this is what we know about novel coronavirus.
1882,tcsWEhm0Bcs.mp4,I hope you liked the video if you liked it.

1886,bRfAUGMKlnk.mp4,The CDC recently issued new guidelines saying people who smoke and Vapor are at higher risk for more severe complications and hospitalization if they get covid-19 the CDC analyzed data from confirmed cases across the u.s.
1887,bRfAUGMKlnk.mp4,"Between mid-February and late March it found about 78% of ICU coronavirus patients and 71% of other hospitalized covid-19 patients had one or more reported underlying health conditions, like lung disease diabetes or heart disease all of which."
1888,bRfAUGMKlnk.mp4,Have been linked to smoking Jonathan when a cough is a professor of pediatrics at Harvard Medical School and director of translational research at the American Academy of Pediatrics.
1889,bRfAUGMKlnk.mp4,He says both smoking and vaping affect the body's ability to fight off infections and they compromise the immune system making it more susceptible to covid-19 heard of a patient 22 years old who was hospitalized and her only risk factor was that she was vaping So this creates a huge problem for us is pediatricians creates a lot of anxiety.
1890,bRfAUGMKlnk.mp4,I think in terms of our parents and four teens themselves.
1891,bRfAUGMKlnk.mp4,So we don't know everything there is to know about vaping and lung risk and covid-19.
1892,bRfAUGMKlnk.mp4,But right now what we're seeing is very concerning other systematic reviews have also shown higher risk for covid-19 deaths or ICU cases among people who smoked or formerly smoked meat.
1893,bRfAUGMKlnk.mp4,"While the CDC continues to recommend that people who are sick, especially people with underlying health conditions stay at home except to get medical care sick or not."
1894,bRfAUGMKlnk.mp4,Staying home is something Matthew Myers with the campaign for tobacco-free kids says could be an opportunity to quit smoking or vaping today anything to put your lungs at risk makes you more vulnerable.
1895,bRfAUGMKlnk.mp4,"What we're encouraging parents to do is sit down with their Teens have an honest open and objective conversation with them to make sure that teens understand that vaping is not a harmless activity that it not only leads to addiction potentially long-term addiction, but that there are other diseases associated with it then cease newsy, Denver."
1896,VDNzmY7Ek6E.mp4,What will a covid-19 vaccine be ready in the UK?
1897,VDNzmY7Ek6E.mp4,"Well, it depends who you ask the head of the UK vaccine task force thinks there's a chance of vaccine could be ready this side of Christmas, but the government's Chief scientific adviser believes."
1898,VDNzmY7Ek6E.mp4,"We're unlikely to see one before spring 2021 and that's because in the history of making vaccines, it has never taken less than about five years to develop one from scratch to develop a vaccine which will mimic covid so that it Giggles the body's immune response to make antibodies against the virus is one thing but to make sure that it's safe and effective for millions of people to use is quite another which is why it has to go through rigorous testing after lab tests on either human or animal cells it then goes to human trials the first phase involves a group of around 50 people to see how safe it is."
1899,VDNzmY7Ek6E.mp4,"The second phase uses a large group of around a hundred people to see how effective it is and the third phase of Men, testing uses a huge cross-section of people often in the tens of thousands."
1900,VDNzmY7Ek6E.mp4,Once it's passed the trial stage it then gets license manufactured then distributed.
1901,VDNzmY7Ek6E.mp4,"All of this normally takes about ten years, but covid-19 vaccine developers are trying to get the time down to around 12 to 18 months and they're doing this by overlapping some of the human trials deliberately exposing volunteer to the virus and Manufacturing the vaccine whilst it's still being tested."
1902,VDNzmY7Ek6E.mp4,So how close are we to a vaccine?
1903,VDNzmY7Ek6E.mp4,There are over a hundred vaccine trials being carried out all over the world several are already in Phase 3 of the human trials and China and Russia have even approved some vaccines for limited use but according to the World Health organization's list of candidate vaccines.
1904,VDNzmY7Ek6E.mp4,The human trials are Oxford University are a more advanced stage than any other and so far approving to induce an immune response Willa vaccine mean an end to lockdowns.
1905,VDNzmY7Ek6E.mp4,Italy life isn't likely to go back to normal overnight because the first vaccines may only be partially effective and may not work for everyone like the flu jab the head of the UK's vaccine task force has warned that a covid jab may only be 50% effective which means social distancing measures and face masks aren't going away anytime soon.
1906,VDNzmY7Ek6E.mp4,"The head of the Oxford vaccine team says covid safe measures could continue until July 20 21, so Who will get the vaccine initially there will be a limited Supply."
1907,VDNzmY7Ek6E.mp4,So the head of the UK vaccine task force says in the UK the most vulnerable people will be prioritized.

1909,s7G6-ol1GsM.mp4,The ability to learn can be stifled by environment and access to technology yet 12 students sharing worries.
1910,s7G6-ol1GsM.mp4,She's fallen behind as for a while.
1911,s7G6-ol1GsM.mp4,She struggled to get hold of a laptop the government and schools expect us to like maintain the expectations.
1912,s7G6-ol1GsM.mp4,They have grade wise and some of us being at a disadvantage can't necessarily produce that expectation.
1913,s7G6-ol1GsM.mp4,And one student is so frustrated.
1914,s7G6-ol1GsM.mp4,He wrote to Sky News to complain that the government isn't doing enough to as he put it mitigate the months of lost learning Aaron Billingsley a year 10 from Sutton coldfield is worried about the damage to next year's gcses when we go back to school.
1915,s7G6-ol1GsM.mp4,"Everyone will be at different stages of their courses and we'll have mock exam start in year 11 and we will only have half of the syllabus and attends Fairfax Academy, which says it offers students Five Lessons a day and keeps in touch through online."
1916,s7G6-ol1GsM.mp4,"Surveys phone calls and video, but Aaron's fellow pupil Lily says the government should ensure that schools can have digital face-to-face contact."
1917,s7G6-ol1GsM.mp4,They could definitely get schools like encourage scores to put us on Zoom cause more and utilize all of these things that we could be using what we would normally be spending in lesson and getting support from the teachers.
1918,s7G6-ol1GsM.mp4,"We are spending on our own and when we do need that help you can message the teachers and I've most of them do reply but some of them don't so they company teacher tab found hundreds of thousands of students mostly from disadvantaged backgrounds are studying for less than an hour a day since schools closed in deprived areas 43% of secondary school teachers said their pupil studied for less than an hour, which compares to just 4% in private schools and 14% in affluent intake State schools where students work for much longer at home."
1919,s7G6-ol1GsM.mp4,This work ethic Gap is widening as the lockdown continues and teach tap says the It's set minimum standards of Education in this period be in a position where I'm at.
1920,s7G6-ol1GsM.mp4,"Testing the government has promised 200,000 laptops for disadvantaged children if not me."
1921,s7G6-ol1GsM.mp4,So I think that's happening because they know that they haven't made sure that every people has got the ability to do it.
1922,s7G6-ol1GsM.mp4,I think that this coronavirus exposes a deep digital divide in our country the digital Haves and the digital have-nots.
1923,s7G6-ol1GsM.mp4,We must have some schools.
1924,s7G6-ol1GsM.mp4,We must offer.

1937,7z0kzYpuqhw.mp4,"Coronavirus has are a large family of viruses that get their name from the Halo of Spike proteins on their outer surface, which resemble a crown the corona under a microscope."
1938,7z0kzYpuqhw.mp4,The new coronavirus is called SARS Covey to SARS Covey to stands for severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus.Run a virus to as the new virus it means they previously no one in the world has been infected with it and therefore no one has antibodies to it because no one has antibodies.
1939,7z0kzYpuqhw.mp4,Everyone is at risk for catching the virus becoming ill and spreading the virus with the discovery of SARS Covey to there are now seven types of coronavirus has known to affect humans for regularly circulating humans and mostly cause mild to moderate upper respiratory tract symptoms that most people think of as the common cold SARS Covey to causes a disease called covid-19 a severe respiratory illness covid-19 can be deadly particularly for older people and those with underlying health conditions.
1940,7z0kzYpuqhw.mp4,The virus is spread through droplets in the air after coughing or sneezing which people nearby can take in through their nose mouth or eyes.
1941,7z0kzYpuqhw.mp4,The virus can also spread by touch.
1942,7z0kzYpuqhw.mp4,"A contaminated surface, but it's unclear how long the virus lives on surfaces once inside your body the virus travels quickly to the back of your nasal passages and to the mucous membranes in the back of your throat."
1943,7z0kzYpuqhw.mp4,The virus attaches to a receptor called Angiotensin converting enzyme to or a stew on respiratory cells in your body the viruses genetic material enters your cells the virus then hijacks your cells to produce.
1944,7z0kzYpuqhw.mp4,"copies of itself which go on to infect more cells the time between the initial infection and the first symptoms appearing varies widely, but is five days on average symptoms often start in the back of the throat with a dry cough and sore throat along with a fever symptoms become more severe as the infection starts making its way to your lower respiratory tract here it can cause more respiratory problems like bronchitis and pneumonia when the virus Your lungs it causes inflammation in the air sacs in your lungs which are called alveoli your alveoli are where oxygen and carbon dioxide are exchanged in ammonia."
1945,7z0kzYpuqhw.mp4,There is swelling decreased air flow and your alveoli start to fill with fluid causing shortness of breath and difficulty breathing.
1946,7z0kzYpuqhw.mp4,Some people need a ventilator to help them breathe less oxygen in your blood deprives other major organs of oxygen including your liver.
1947,7z0kzYpuqhw.mp4,Her kidney and brain acute respiratory distress caused by widespread swelling in the lungs.
1948,7z0kzYpuqhw.mp4,Stop your body from getting the oxygen it needs to survive.
1949,7z0kzYpuqhw.mp4,This respiratory distress can lead to organ failure and death while covid-19 can be deadly the vast majority around 80% of cases are mild to moderate and people recover within a week or two.
1950,UaU97wfJOp0.mp4,So 43 States 43 are seeing a rise in cases and this morning.
1951,UaU97wfJOp0.mp4,We wanted to get a real-time look at what's happening on the ground in one state in particular that's dealing with a major surge.
1952,UaU97wfJOp0.mp4,We're talking about Wisconsin hospitalizations.
1953,UaU97wfJOp0.mp4,"There had doubled within the last month, and dr. Jeff pot office on the front lines there."
1954,UaU97wfJOp0.mp4,He's an ER physician.
1955,UaU97wfJOp0.mp4,"He's also Chief quality officer at University Hospital in Madison, Wisconsin doctor pot off."
1956,UaU97wfJOp0.mp4,Good morning to you.
1957,UaU97wfJOp0.mp4,I know you're busy.
1958,UaU97wfJOp0.mp4,So thanks so much for your time.
1959,UaU97wfJOp0.mp4,Good to be on the show with all of you it give us a snapshot if you can of the situation at your hospital how many patients are coming in compared to what you saw just a few months ago.
1960,UaU97wfJOp0.mp4,How worried are you as we head into this holiday season?
1961,UaU97wfJOp0.mp4,"Yeah, you know compared to our previous peaks in March and April are volumes are doubled we continue to break record number of patients each day in our hospital and we're having to expand our footprint for covid-19 patients before we might have been able to take care of all those patients on One Wing of a unit now, all three wings of that unit are full and we're looking for more space."
1962,UaU97wfJOp0.mp4,"So I'd love to tell you that we're doing great, but we're struggling my goodness."
1963,UaU97wfJOp0.mp4,I was just about to ask you obviously the pandemic has been around since March but this is the first time Wisconsin specifically Has dealt with these large numbers so did the gift of time over the spring and summer help you at all as far as preparing for the Rave?
1964,UaU97wfJOp0.mp4,"Yeah, you know, we watched very carefully what happened in New York and Washington State and that got us to take action."
1965,UaU97wfJOp0.mp4,"We made very robust plans on how we could optimize every square inch of our infrastructure to care for covid patients and that's been invaluable now that we've had a dust off that plan and act on it but really the biggest constraint we have our Critical Care staff, you know, we can convert Rooms we can get some supplies."
1966,UaU97wfJOp0.mp4,It's hard to create new Critical Care nurses in critical care physicians.
1967,UaU97wfJOp0.mp4,Dr. Jeff.
1968,UaU97wfJOp0.mp4,"You've got experts saying the one thing we can do is wear a mask to help ameliorate these issues and you've got a Statewide mandate there in Wisconsin, but it seems compliance kind of haphazard."
1969,UaU97wfJOp0.mp4,What do you think wearing or not wearing a mask has kind of become like a political statement.
1970,UaU97wfJOp0.mp4,Yeah.
1971,UaU97wfJOp0.mp4,"I think that's a really interesting thing that people talk about for a long time, but, you know here in Wisconsin."
1972,UaU97wfJOp0.mp4,I think we've done a really good job of sending citizens a mixed message one leader will say you need to wear a mask.
1973,UaU97wfJOp0.mp4,It's really important.
1974,UaU97wfJOp0.mp4,Things are bad.
1975,UaU97wfJOp0.mp4,"Then another leader will say, you know, what that coronavirus not such a big deal."
1976,UaU97wfJOp0.mp4,We're not even sure masks are effective and people are trying to make educated decisions to keep themselves and their families safe.
1977,UaU97wfJOp0.mp4,"But unfortunately with all that misinformation out there, they're making a wrong assessment of the risk that they're taking on by not wearing a mask and not distancing and what do you think is going on here?"
1978,UaU97wfJOp0.mp4,"Because I mean at the beginning of this it was Is talked about so often that everything needs to shut down, you know restaurants are closed doors are closed."
1979,UaU97wfJOp0.mp4,But do you think with the rise in cases now that areas like Madison or Milwaukee or just the whole state in general should begin tightening restrictions.
1980,UaU97wfJOp0.mp4,I mean could lockdowns be possible once again.
1981,UaU97wfJOp0.mp4,You know if we look at what happened earlier when we started to have a safe ride home order.
1982,UaU97wfJOp0.mp4,We started to have a mass mandates at least at the county level.
1983,UaU97wfJOp0.mp4,It absolutely was effective our curve flattened.
1984,UaU97wfJOp0.mp4,"And if you look what we did after that, which is kind of let everyone decide what they want to do for themselves."
1985,UaU97wfJOp0.mp4,That's not working for us.
1986,UaU97wfJOp0.mp4,We have people getting sick we have people dying.
1987,UaU97wfJOp0.mp4,"So I don't know if we need to have you know, you know machete like lockdowns all over but certainly something that is mandated that really gives a clear message to the citizens of the state what they need to do to keep themselves state to safe to get things back to normal."
1988,UaU97wfJOp0.mp4,That would be welcome.
1989,UaU97wfJOp0.mp4,"I know people are feeling covid fatigued, but we have to hang in there."
1990,UaU97wfJOp0.mp4,Dr. Jeff pot help.
1991,UaU97wfJOp0.mp4,Thank you for your time and what you're doing out there.
1992,UaU97wfJOp0.mp4,Thank you.

1994,3K25G4y53Sg.mp4,I am a epidemiology fellow at the US Centers for Disease Control and prevention and I work on a team that conducts behavioral epidemiology research to understand barriers to vaccine uptake in low and middle income countries misinformation and disinformation about vaccines results in a growing burden of avoidable morbidity and mortality.
1995,3K25G4y53Sg.mp4,And so info demek management is really critical in order to protect the human rights.Help not only related to vaccines but giving my background and immunization research.
1996,3K25G4y53Sg.mp4,I was particularly interested in discussions happened in this conference about the concept of social inoculation and how similar two biological inoculations that confer immunity against infectious pathogens pre-emptive messages warning individuals about circulating misinformation and expose them to strategies used by those promoting misinformation.
1997,3K25G4y53Sg.mp4,Chinook can actually confer cognitive immunity and for the ability to resist future exposures to misinformation.
1998,3K25G4y53Sg.mp4,"So I thought that was really fascinating but beyond that specific topic, I was really interested to learn lessons from a variety of different disciplines on strategies that could be used in info demek management."
1999,3K25G4y53Sg.mp4,So understanding strategies that could be relevant from marketing or from anthropology or epidemiology.
2000,3K25G4y53Sg.mp4,"And so I'm really grateful to to the conference participants, of course, but also the organizers for creating this platform in which we can sort of fit together the various puzzle pieces that are needed and to get a broader picture of where we are and where we want to be."
2001,3K25G4y53Sg.mp4,Thank you very much.
2002,cM0avR1zQyA.mp4,The critical need for a vaccine tonight.
2003,cM0avR1zQyA.mp4,One of the most promising trials in the world is actually being done right here in the Bay Area Stanford doctor started the phase 3 trial of the Johnson and Johnson vaccine today to figure out if it is effective Embassy berries Ian called spoke with a doctor leading the effort and one of the people getting vaccinated.
2004,cM0avR1zQyA.mp4,New video shows the first injection for a covid-19 vaccine trial at Stanford.
2005,cM0avR1zQyA.mp4,It's the Johnson and Johnson sponsored study.
2006,cM0avR1zQyA.mp4,"Dr. Philip Grant is the principal investigator, you know, I do other clinical studies as well, but it's nice to be be helping out getting something that hopefully will be available in the spring time sometime this phase 3 trial will be done at 180 sites around the world with 60,000 participants."
2007,cM0avR1zQyA.mp4,"They'll do 1,000 at Stanford."
2008,cM0avR1zQyA.mp4,It's a Blind study.
2009,cM0avR1zQyA.mp4,So some will get active vaccine others will get a placebo and they will all be monitored.
2010,cM0avR1zQyA.mp4,Hopefully will prevent both total number of infections as well.
2011,cM0avR1zQyA.mp4,As number of severe infections.
2012,cM0avR1zQyA.mp4,The vaccine essentially uses a common cold virus to deliver coronavirus genetic material into the body.
2013,cM0avR1zQyA.mp4,The goal is to spark an immune response.
2014,cM0avR1zQyA.mp4,"They wouldn't be you know, administering this to 60,000 people if there wasn't a level of confidence in what they're doing Stanford Graduate and aspiring physician Walter, so Abba got the bay area's first dose this morning."
2015,cM0avR1zQyA.mp4,If there's any way that you know me volunteering to participate in this can be of service to the rest of our community both locally.
2016,cM0avR1zQyA.mp4,And globally I'm very happy to be involved in that.
2017,cM0avR1zQyA.mp4,There are now four vaccines in critical stage 3 human trials in the country Johnson & Johnson's was briefly on hold after a participant got sick AstraZeneca is was also pause for the same reason but both trials have resumed in fact Tweak researchers in the AstraZeneca trial with Oxford say their vaccine has shown to have a strong immune response in elderly people and moderna says by the end of this year it expects to have approximately 20 million doses ready to ship in the u.s.
2018,cM0avR1zQyA.mp4,Though.
2019,cM0avR1zQyA.mp4,It's still in stage 3.
2020,cM0avR1zQyA.mp4,Dr. Anthony found.
2021,cM0avR1zQyA.mp4,She says we should know more in weeks projections that we have that I think and I hope will be reasonably accurate that we will know sometime in December whether or not we have a safe and effective.
2022,cM0avR1zQyA.mp4,The vaccine and practically speaking.
2023,cM0avR1zQyA.mp4,When will we be able to deploy That vaccine people in the Stanford trial will take a phone survey every week to see if they have symptoms.
2024,cM0avR1zQyA.mp4,Dr. Grant says they still need more volunteers right now.
2025,cM0avR1zQyA.mp4,We're doing that young healthy individuals and older healthy individuals.
2026,cM0avR1zQyA.mp4,"If you don't fit in that category, we will later call you once we moved on to people with chronic conditions each will be monitored periodically over two years, but the data on if it works."
2027,cM0avR1zQyA.mp4,I will come much sooner Ian Cole NBC Bay Area News.
2028,5hu7_xIsCRg.mp4,As part of its effort to respond to the covid-19 pandemic FDA plays an important role in helping to support the development of accurate and reliable test in the u.s.
2029,5hu7_xIsCRg.mp4,There are two main categories of tests in the fight against covid-19 diagnostic tests and antibody tests diagnostic tests can tell you if you currently have an infection the FDA has authorized many diagnostic test for covid-19 including molecular test.
2030,5hu7_xIsCRg.mp4,Molecular tests work by looking for the viruses genetic material in his sample from you.
2031,5hu7_xIsCRg.mp4,The sample is then usually analyzed in a lab for some test the sample can be analyzed at the point of care such as at a doctor's office FDA authorized molecular tests are very accurate and results are returned anywhere from minutes to several days depending on the test antigen test or another type of diagnostic tests that see if there are viral proteins in a sample taken from inside your nose with a Of these tests are often simpler and may provide results quicker than many molecular tests.
2032,5hu7_xIsCRg.mp4,Sometimes within minutes in a doctor's office.
2033,5hu7_xIsCRg.mp4,Although antigen test can be less accurate and may need confirmation with an additional diagnostic tests.
2034,5hu7_xIsCRg.mp4,They can be made more widely available because they're easy and simple the other category of test is an antibody test.
2035,5hu7_xIsCRg.mp4,Sometimes called a serology tests antibodies are produced by your body when you're infected by a virus and they help you.
2036,5hu7_xIsCRg.mp4,Your immune system fight off the infection an antibody test detects antibodies to the virus using a blood sample.
2037,5hu7_xIsCRg.mp4,If an antibody test finds antibodies in the blood it likely means the person has been previously infected with the virus antibody tests do not show if you have a current infection and they should not be used to diagnose a current infection from covid-19 the results from antibody tests can help us better understand questions about exposure to covid-19.
2038,5hu7_xIsCRg.mp4,By helping identify who has been infected and has developed antibodies.
2039,5hu7_xIsCRg.mp4,"If antibodies May provide protection from future infection who may still be at risk or who made the eligible to donate a part of their blood called convalescent plasma, which may serve as a possible treatment for those who are seriously ill from covid-19."
2040,5hu7_xIsCRg.mp4,If you have questions about covid-19 diagnostic or antibody test talk to your doctor testing is crucial to guiding our next steps.

2042,Wy6xtIRAVAY.mp4,While countries around the world continue to mobilize to contain the spread of covid-19 mental health experts say we can't lose sight of an equally alarming issue the long-term mental health impact the pandemic is going to leave on society.
2043,Wy6xtIRAVAY.mp4,What I think we're facing here is a very traumatic event for a lot of people.
2044,Wy6xtIRAVAY.mp4,It's a traumatic societal event for people and one thing that we know about trauma.
2045,Wy6xtIRAVAY.mp4,Is that while it's happening you do whatever you can do to survive you Bear Down.
2046,Wy6xtIRAVAY.mp4,"Down and you just get through it, which is what we're all trying to do right now."
2047,Wy6xtIRAVAY.mp4,"I think that we're still very much in the trauma phase the act of trauma phase of this pandemic, but what happens after physical distancing measures are lifted what comes after the pandemic is over and people are able to get back to whatever they're normal."
2048,Wy6xtIRAVAY.mp4,"Maybe there's going to be residual stress depression, certainly Financial pressures learning how to re-engage with the world in this new way that's going to be difficult for Of people and those are exactly the kinds of risk factors that lead to increasing rates of depression anxiety and even suicide the rapid spread of the pandemic gave little chance to prepare for or even process all that has happened in terms of job losses and the complete uprooting of everyday life and relationships Maggie who is a student at McMaster University who suffers from a generalized anxiety disorder I shut down because of I don't know what to do."
2049,Wy6xtIRAVAY.mp4,I'm not prepared for this.
2050,Wy6xtIRAVAY.mp4,I was I did not run run a rehearsal of the situation in my head.
2051,Wy6xtIRAVAY.mp4,It's exhausting to not worry because it is practically impossible for me to not worry Panic says for those already suffering from anxiety and depression.
2052,Wy6xtIRAVAY.mp4,The pandemic could be exasperated their symptoms.
2053,Wy6xtIRAVAY.mp4,He is also concerned for those who have never suffered from any mental health issues in the past and are now facing a life disruption.
2054,Wy6xtIRAVAY.mp4,Fully digesting the long-term impact this may have on them a large body of scientific studies show that there is a close relationship between indicator such as unemployment mental health and suicide research out of the Great Recession of 2008 reveals that a 1% increase in unemployment was accompanied by 1% increase in the rates of suicides in the US Hennig explains.
2055,Wy6xtIRAVAY.mp4,There is a peak and a valley response in our nervous system when faced with AMA right.
2056,Wy6xtIRAVAY.mp4,"Now we are at a peak in which we are engaging with the immediate threat of the pandemic you go into survival mode, which can be very taxing on a person's mental health."
2057,Wy6xtIRAVAY.mp4,"And in fact, it doesn't actually let you think through our process what's happening to you."
2058,Wy6xtIRAVAY.mp4,It's only interest is in getting and keeping you alive and keeping you safe.
2059,Wy6xtIRAVAY.mp4,Once the pandemic is over.
2060,Wy6xtIRAVAY.mp4,"There will be a valley in which we recover from that threat, but the problem is going back to Baseline without support can take a lot longer than we May think after the threat passes hanok says people can start to retreat or fall into depression or find many other ways of dissociating themselves with the trauma."
2061,Wy6xtIRAVAY.mp4,They experienced it can really become almost an infection on its own some people stay stuck either way at the top of that Peak or they stay stuck down at the bottom or anywhere in between not everybody returns to Baseline.
2062,Wy6xtIRAVAY.mp4,And that's where we become concerned about mental illness in Canada.
2063,Wy6xtIRAVAY.mp4,We currently have Universal Medicare Cool care but things like Psychotherapy which henick says has proven to be an effective treatment for mental health problems generally isn't funded publicly.
2064,Wy6xtIRAVAY.mp4,Henick says the federal and provincial governments need to step up to make sure proper treatments and programs are funded.
2065,Wy6xtIRAVAY.mp4,So as many people as possible have access when in need adding that everyone including employers will have to play a role.
2066,Wy6xtIRAVAY.mp4,I think it's important for employers and particular to realize when we start to loosen some of the restrictions that were currently Facing that this needs to happen slowly that we can't go back to the way the world was overnight as for Maggie.
2067,Wy6xtIRAVAY.mp4,She says she already knows she won't be able to go from 0 to 100 right away.
2068,Wy6xtIRAVAY.mp4,I hope that was the virus slowly dying down my social supports like psychiatrist counselor therapist will L. Get those supports back slowly and help me with my current fears.
2069,Wy6xtIRAVAY.mp4,And uncertainties.

2108,tZMnLNo8-QY.mp4,"We are less than 24 hours from election day President Trump and former Vice President, Joe."
2109,tZMnLNo8-QY.mp4,Biden will continue to make their final appeals to voters in campaign appearances today Face the Nation moderator Margaret Brennan has interviewed both candidates and she joins us now.
2110,tZMnLNo8-QY.mp4,Good morning to you Margaret Brennan.
2111,tZMnLNo8-QY.mp4,Good morning to you Gail.
2112,tZMnLNo8-QY.mp4,"So, you know both candidates."
2113,tZMnLNo8-QY.mp4,I know you're on calls with both campaigns last week and they're both say they feel very confident.
2114,tZMnLNo8-QY.mp4,"I don't expect any candidate to say, you know, it's not looking good for us."
2115,tZMnLNo8-QY.mp4,I'm very worried but does any candidate in your opinion have reason to feel more confident than the others?
2116,tZMnLNo8-QY.mp4,We stand here today 24 hours out.
2117,tZMnLNo8-QY.mp4,"Well, the Democrats can look at those banked votes that early vote and feel good about the edge."
2118,tZMnLNo8-QY.mp4,They have in certain States.
2119,tZMnLNo8-QY.mp4,But as the head of the Republican Party Ronnie McDaniel told me on Face the Nation.
2120,tZMnLNo8-QY.mp4,And yesterday she feels that because they have sent staff door-to-door in key States asking Republicans.
2121,tZMnLNo8-QY.mp4,"Hey, why haven't you voted yet?"
2122,tZMnLNo8-QY.mp4,They believe there is a surge that we haven't seen yet that will show up in person tomorrow.
2123,tZMnLNo8-QY.mp4,"And if you look at States like Florida and Texas Republicans who are showing up to vote early have chipped away at some of the democratic lead in those States, but President Trump is really going to be very heavily dependent on his Porter's showing up in large numbers tomorrow and Joe Biden is going to be heavily dependent on those votes that are still out there particularly young voters that the Biden campaign is batting on Margaret."
2124,tZMnLNo8-QY.mp4,The the president's closing message appears to be a return to normal or return to a time before the coronavirus and yet as he makes that pitch to voters in 13 Battleground States cases of the virus are surging how do those two facts intersect in effect election day.
2125,tZMnLNo8-QY.mp4,Surging 45 percent over the past two weeks and those 13 Battleground States.
2126,tZMnLNo8-QY.mp4,"I mean at a certain point Tony you asked how long will the president's supporters allow him to deny the facts in their own communities of spiking infection rates and hospitalization rates, but to this point and many of the president's supporters that I've spoken to when we do these voter focus groups."
2127,tZMnLNo8-QY.mp4,Tell us look it could have been worse and he's doing the best he can there's an acceptance somehow but as this gets worse heading into the winter.
2128,tZMnLNo8-QY.mp4,Are you wonder when the facts will overcome the politics certainly for the Biden campaign?
2129,tZMnLNo8-QY.mp4,"They believe that their strongest message is to remind the public that the president didn't protect the American people against a pandemic that has killed more than 200,000 people for the Trump campaign."
2130,tZMnLNo8-QY.mp4,"They continue to argue don't believe the headlines even though in States like Wisconsin, which are going to be so key for the president that inspecting infection rate could have an impact even on turnout tomorrow."
2131,tZMnLNo8-QY.mp4,As the governor really warns people.
2132,tZMnLNo8-QY.mp4,It's dangerous to go out.
2133,tZMnLNo8-QY.mp4,I know let's let's hit on that don't believe the headlines thing for just a second marker because now President Trump is saying that speculating out loud that he may fire Anthony falchi after the election.
2134,tZMnLNo8-QY.mp4,This is after a campaign stop where people were screaming in the crowd fire foul.
2135,tZMnLNo8-QY.mp4,"She fire falchi, the president seems to be stoking that fat."
2136,tZMnLNo8-QY.mp4,She has made it very clear that this is a very dangerous time.
2137,tZMnLNo8-QY.mp4,He's telling us all be careful with your Thanksgiving plans.
2138,tZMnLNo8-QY.mp4,What do you make of that?
2139,tZMnLNo8-QY.mp4,Well at a certain point it becomes troubling to hear.
2140,tZMnLNo8-QY.mp4,Yeah deeply troubling to hear.
2141,tZMnLNo8-QY.mp4,Dr. Fuji himself say in that interview.
2142,tZMnLNo8-QY.mp4,He gave to the Washington Post the bit that that really struck me was when he flat out said that the president won't listen to his briefings or dr. Burke's anymore because it doesn't fit the political message.
2143,tZMnLNo8-QY.mp4,So you have the nation's top epidemiologist saying the political folks don't want to listen to the science and the facts.
2144,tZMnLNo8-QY.mp4,And so for a doctor who says he has no political agenda that is obviously a warning to those out there that they are at greater risk than what they are being told.
2145,tZMnLNo8-QY.mp4,So the bottom line here and dr. Gottlieb said this to us on Face the Nation yesterday at a certain point the facts are going to overcome the politics.
2146,tZMnLNo8-QY.mp4,The question is when he's saying it's going to be after the election in.
2147,tZMnLNo8-QY.mp4,Thanks that Thanksgiving period Then it is really going to hit us hard and it's going to become undeniable that we are not around.
2148,tZMnLNo8-QY.mp4,"The curve in fact, it's coming at us hard."
2149,tZMnLNo8-QY.mp4,And that's why Margaret Brown people are feeling so stressed.
2150,tZMnLNo8-QY.mp4,Thank you very much.
2151,OHfMUxOQNME.mp4,We're just so so thankful for everything.
2152,OHfMUxOQNME.mp4,I was surprised at how emotional I gottaIt's amazing to get to see patients go home.Everybody's help I may not survive.
2153,OHfMUxOQNME.mp4,I want to say thank you from the bottom of my heart without them.
2154,OHfMUxOQNME.mp4,It wouldn't I wouldn't be getting as well as I am today when she came in they weren't sure if she would make it and I got to be other out the door.
2155,Gnve311oahs.mp4,As we enter the flu season Public Health experts are warning about a so-called twin endemic of the flu and covid-19.
2156,Gnve311oahs.mp4,Now many people are wondering how to tell if they're cough is just a cold or covid-19 CBS News medical contributor.
2157,Gnve311oahs.mp4,Dr. David agus joins us now with some answers to these questions.
2158,Gnve311oahs.mp4,Dr. Agus.
2159,Gnve311oahs.mp4,Good morning.
2160,Gnve311oahs.mp4,So how do you do it?
2161,Gnve311oahs.mp4,You've got a cold you've got the flu and then you've got the coronavirus there are some similarities but there are a lot of important differences.
2162,Gnve311oahs.mp4,Can you walk us through them?
2163,Gnve311oahs.mp4,"Sure, Tony, so they're all viruses right coronavirus causes the common cold covid-19 obviously and then influenza A and B, cause the flu and the body's immune response to viruses causes you to have fever chills cause you to potentially have diarrhea headache and so they're they're immune response to the virus."
2164,Gnve311oahs.mp4,The body doesn't care which virus it is a virus is a virus.
2165,Gnve311oahs.mp4,So the similar the symptoms are remarkably similar what's unique to covid is that Change in taste and smell that happens in some people but but not all but the symptoms are really overlapping.
2166,Gnve311oahs.mp4,So it's going to cause issue as we get into the season.
2167,Gnve311oahs.mp4,So then what guidance would you give people about precisely when they should go to their doctor or at least called her doctor?
2168,Gnve311oahs.mp4,So what these viruses do is they go into your lung and they cause inflammation in the lungs can get leaky and it can make it difficult to breathe and that's what we worry about.
2169,Gnve311oahs.mp4,That's why people need to go to the doctor or the hospital when they have difficulty breathing and that classically means there's too much inflammation in the lung and at that point the doctor will do a rapid test and they can know whether the patient has flu whether the patient has covid-19 or something else like the common cold and make a decision whether that patient needs oxygen or Or can be monitored at home.
2170,Gnve311oahs.mp4,The other is you can have a pulse ox at home and you can actually measure your own oxygen.
2171,Gnve311oahs.mp4,And so if it starts to dip below 94% then it's time to call your doctor.
2172,Gnve311oahs.mp4,And what is your biggest concern as we enter a period where we're going to have the flu and the coronavirus side by side.
2173,Gnve311oahs.mp4,What worries you as you look at what could happen to the country?
2174,Gnve311oahs.mp4,"Well, you know in many parts of the country now where there are spikes in cases."
2175,Gnve311oahs.mp4,"The hospitals are starting to be full the icy user full you couple that with the flu and you have a double whammy there which really emphasizes the need for flu vaccination, you know, you can treat the flu by me prevent the flu with a vaccine in many cases and that is critical."
2176,Gnve311oahs.mp4,The other key is diagnosis.
2177,Gnve311oahs.mp4,"Remember if you diagnose the flu early through a test, you can take a drug and Tamiflu or one of the other anti-flu drugs or give it to your family members."
2178,Gnve311oahs.mp4,Us before they're symptomatic and they won't get sick.
2179,Gnve311oahs.mp4,So it's really important that we keep testing going in the country.
2180,Gnve311oahs.mp4,"All right, so pay attention."
2181,_UOvPrPoY-s.mp4,Coronavirus has are a large family of enveloped RNA viruses.
2182,_UOvPrPoY-s.mp4,"There are four groups of coronavirus has Alpha and beta originated from bats and rodents and Gamma and Delta originated from avian species coronavirus has are responsible for a wide range of diseases in many animals, including livestock and pets in humans."
2183,_UOvPrPoY-s.mp4,They were thought to cause mild self-limiting respiratory infections until 2002.When a beta coronavirus crossed species barriers from bats to a mammalian host before jumping to humans causing the severe acute respiratory syndrome SARS epidemic more recently.
2184,_UOvPrPoY-s.mp4,Another be Decora.
2185,_UOvPrPoY-s.mp4,No virus is responsible for the serious Middle East Respiratory Syndrome or MERS started in 2012.
2186,_UOvPrPoY-s.mp4,The novel coronavirus responsible for the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic covid-19 is also a Beta coronavirus the Genome of the virus is fully sequenced and appears to be most similar to a strain in bats suggesting that it also originated from bats.
2187,_UOvPrPoY-s.mp4,The virus is also very similar to the SARS coronavirus and is therefore named SARS coronavirus to SARS Covey to at the moment.
2188,_UOvPrPoY-s.mp4,"It's not yet clear if the virus jumped directly from bats to humans or if there is a mammalian intermediate host coronavirus genome is a Judge, single-stranded positive sense RNA molecule that contains all information necessary for the making of viral components."
2189,_UOvPrPoY-s.mp4,The RNA is coded with structural proteins forming a complex known as nucleocapsid.
2190,_UOvPrPoY-s.mp4,"The nucleocapsid is enclosed in an envelope, which is basically a lipid membrane with embedded proteins from the envelope club like spikes emanate giving the appearance of a crown."
2191,_UOvPrPoY-s.mp4,This is where the corona name came.
2192,_UOvPrPoY-s.mp4,I'm from the Integrity of the envelope is essential for viral infection.
2193,_UOvPrPoY-s.mp4,And is the Achilles heel of the virus because the lipid membrane can easily be destroyed by lipid solvents such as detergents alcohol and some disinfectants.
2194,_UOvPrPoY-s.mp4,In fact enveloped viruses are the easiest to inactivate when they are outside a host.
2195,_UOvPrPoY-s.mp4,"In order to infect a host cell the spikes of the virus must bind to a molecule on the cell surface called a receptor the specificity of this binding explains why viruses are usually species-specific they have receptors in certain species and not others host jumping is usually triggered by mutations in Spike proteins, which change them in a way that they can now bind to a receptor in a new species the novel Coronavirus."
2196,_UOvPrPoY-s.mp4,This appears to use the same receptor as SARS coronavirus for entry to human cells.
2197,_UOvPrPoY-s.mp4,"And that receptor is the angiotensin-converting enzyme to a stew infection usually starts with the cells of the respiratory mucosa, then spreads to epithelial cells of alveoli in the lungs receptor binding is followed by Fusion of the viral membrane with the host membrane and the release of nucleocapsid into the cell."
2198,_UOvPrPoY-s.mp4,The virus then uses the host Machinery to replicate producing viral rnas and proteins.
2199,_UOvPrPoY-s.mp4,"These are then assembled into new viral particles called very Young's the new very ons are released and the host cell dies uncontrolled growth of the virus destroys respiratory tissues producing symptoms infection triggers, the body's inflammatory response, which brings immune cells to the site to fight the virus."
2200,_UOvPrPoY-s.mp4,While inflammation is an important defense mechanism.
2201,_UOvPrPoY-s.mp4,It may become excessive and cause damage to the body's own tissues contributing to the severity of the disease in an otherwise healthy person.
2202,_UOvPrPoY-s.mp4,There is a good chance that the virus is eventually eliminated and the patient recovers.
2203,_UOvPrPoY-s.mp4,Although some may require support of treatments on the other hand people with weakened immune systems or underlying chronic diseases May progress to severe pneumonia or acute respiratory.
2204,_UOvPrPoY-s.mp4,"Any distress syndrome, which can be fatal."
2205,arneFa08tlU.mp4,As you point out in the last 25 years there have only been seven Novell or I don't pronounce it correctly.
2206,arneFa08tlU.mp4,But these new coronavirus vaccines that have been commercialized.
2207,arneFa08tlU.mp4,What does that mean?
2208,arneFa08tlU.mp4,And what does that mean for all of us who are counting on a vaccine sometime next year?
2209,arneFa08tlU.mp4,Yeah.
2210,arneFa08tlU.mp4,Hi Adam.
2211,arneFa08tlU.mp4,Nice to see you guys.
2212,arneFa08tlU.mp4,Right so last 25 years only seven novel vaccines commercialized for from Merck fastest record.
2213,arneFa08tlU.mp4,Also Merc.
2214,arneFa08tlU.mp4,"Also, it's very telling Merck has been kind of very conservative in their dialogue about the vaccine.So I think as the set up into this section went we have six years of vaccine work that has been condensed into six months that's unprecedented unprecedented amounts of money and time and energy and as a result."
2215,arneFa08tlU.mp4,We have 250 candidates for covid around the world 30 and clinical trials.
2216,arneFa08tlU.mp4,And as your last slide shows 7-9 are now in Phase 3.
2217,arneFa08tlU.mp4,So what this means is there's still a lot of clinical and I would say commercial.
2218,arneFa08tlU.mp4,Ask a lot of people don't talk about the commercial risk.
2219,arneFa08tlU.mp4,But right now if you pull the American people about half would not take the vaccine if it comes out before the election.
2220,arneFa08tlU.mp4,"So now is the time where you go slow to go fast phase 3 is all about that balance between safety and efficacy and getting the dose, right?"
2221,arneFa08tlU.mp4,So AstraZeneca going on pause for a safety event and turning it over to the dsmb is actually not a surprise.
2222,arneFa08tlU.mp4,We should expect that that will happen again as we have 250 candidates around the Old and we want to get it right.
2223,arneFa08tlU.mp4,So I'm pleased to hear that.
2224,arneFa08tlU.mp4,The dsmb is looking at it.
2225,arneFa08tlU.mp4,"I hope that they're very transparent about it because you have a lot of other makers around the world and a lot of other patients and Physicians wanting to understand if this is a systemic issue or as set is it simply a one-off and Megan looking at you know, the different types of vaccines as I was talking about earlier the different delivery methods is definitely a concern but not something that we're seeing a lot about so so is it something that we could even see, you know any potential entry of even a phase 1 by the end of this year?"
2226,arneFa08tlU.mp4,"Are we looking more longer-term by next year to see, you know for the for those patients that can't get an injection something else."
2227,arneFa08tlU.mp4,I know there's speeding up.
2228,arneFa08tlU.mp4,I mean you get the flu vaccine by nasal Administration or shot.
2229,arneFa08tlU.mp4,So I think it's a great Point Anjali because a lot of people don't want to get a shot.
2230,arneFa08tlU.mp4,So if you have half the public that's concerned about getting it and then you have another cohort that doesn't want to get a shot.
2231,arneFa08tlU.mp4,I think they will expedite the delivery.
2232,arneFa08tlU.mp4,Every mechanism and I would anticipate that you'll see more trials using that methodology because it's been used before we have the platform to do it Meghan.
2233,arneFa08tlU.mp4,Once we do eventually get a vaccine.
2234,arneFa08tlU.mp4,I got a notice from Apple today to upgrade my operating system so that I could be tracked and it's all Tech to covid-19.
2235,arneFa08tlU.mp4,Is that going to be necessary once a vaccine is is in use.
2236,arneFa08tlU.mp4,"Yeah, of course it is because you're probably going to need a booster."
2237,arneFa08tlU.mp4,So let's just say seven vaccines are approved at a 250.
2238,arneFa08tlU.mp4,We're in the middle of next year.
2239,arneFa08tlU.mp4,What vaccine did Adam get versus what vaccine did my mom get do need a booster?
2240,arneFa08tlU.mp4,When did you get it?
2241,arneFa08tlU.mp4,How do you track it?
2242,arneFa08tlU.mp4,So I think you're going to see a lot of digital capabilities.
2243,arneFa08tlU.mp4,Kick in to help people manage.
2244,arneFa08tlU.mp4,"What vaccine do you get are some better for the seniors by the way, some not all the vaccines are being studied in over age 55 and 65."
2245,arneFa08tlU.mp4,So what vaccine is most conducive to certain populations?
2246,arneFa08tlU.mp4,I think there's an enormous.
2247,arneFa08tlU.mp4,Aramis amount of tracking that will have to go on and given the numbers a billion doses potentially going forward.
2248,arneFa08tlU.mp4,Somebody has to track that it's impossible to think it would be done on paper and facts Megan Dan Roberts here when we talk about a vaccine and how much the stock market is anticipating it obviously Whoever has the first kind of widely available one.
2249,arneFa08tlU.mp4,We're likely to see their stock surge.
2250,arneFa08tlU.mp4,But I know we've also heard that there's not just going to be one winner here.
2251,arneFa08tlU.mp4,"I'm sure there will be a few different vaccines, but can you explain to us?"
2252,arneFa08tlU.mp4,"I mean that there aren't going to be Be you know, five or six winners, right?"
2253,arneFa08tlU.mp4,I mean how many realistically of these big Pharma companies can actually hit the market and then coexist I guess depending on demand.
2254,arneFa08tlU.mp4,It's a great question.
2255,arneFa08tlU.mp4,"When I was looking at attrition rates, I was saying for example, there was 250 candidates you might get 7 so we don't have 250 candidates and phase 3 right now, so you're right not everyone will make it but it's not a winner-take-all because this will go on for a while."
2256,arneFa08tlU.mp4,And also if you look at the summer biotech is having a bit of an Endless Summer because of covid So there's a lot of activity around not just vaccines but treatments and in fact the first half of this year bio Tech IPOs race close to eight billion dollars and in the first half of the year the FDA was quite busy.
2257,arneFa08tlU.mp4,"They approve 21 percision oncology drugs and there's a whole raft of covid activity following on so I think it's not just our you first what a vaccine are you also going to be involved in some of the treatment and other activity that's going on in the space, which has been incredibly active."
2258,arneFa08tlU.mp4,Of making Fitzgerald is author of ascending Davos and also a Columbia University healthcare policy professor as well as a Tom Hanks fan and a fan of the movie Castaway.
2259,arneFa08tlU.mp4,Say hi to Wilson for us good all the best to you.
2260,arneFa08tlU.mp4,Thank you so much.

2265,Mzs8J31v8sw.mp4,The covid-19 pandemic situation has abruptly and significantly impacted how we operate in all areas of our life.
2266,Mzs8J31v8sw.mp4,"When we resume normal duties like returning to work, especially in a covid situation and trying to incorporate ways to stay safe like using masks everyday distancing washing our hands and then sanitize and more frequently."
2267,Mzs8J31v8sw.mp4,All of those are Second changes that can increase our anxiety so many people don't know this but anxiety is contagious just like the coronavirus is if you're sitting next to somebody who's anxious you may start unconsciously taking on some of the physical symptoms of anxiety.

2270,Mzs8J31v8sw.mp4,One of the things is to take stock of your own physical symptoms if you're feeling anxious Take a minute Center yourself slow your breathing practice mindfulness that will help others around you also to unconsciously relax.
2271,Mzs8J31v8sw.mp4,Then also be careful about not engaging others in their worries on an ongoing basis.
2272,Mzs8J31v8sw.mp4,It's okay to talk to a colleague occasionally about their worries.
2273,Mzs8J31v8sw.mp4,But if that's the primary topic of conversation that leads to Contagion sometimes anxiety can actually be helpful.
2274,Mzs8J31v8sw.mp4,It can motivate us to be more productive more creative more Innovative normal anxiety.

2277,uCbgQzrg9fI.mp4,The virus was first reported about Scotty.
2278,uCbgQzrg9fI.mp4,It seemed children were not being affected by it.
2279,uCbgQzrg9fI.mp4,But now at least seven states reporting cases of a mysterious illness in kids now believed to be related to covid-19 and as NBC news reports it now has an official name.
2280,uCbgQzrg9fI.mp4,It's called pediatric multi-system inflammatory syndrome.
2281,uCbgQzrg9fI.mp4,It's a long word and to discuss this is dr. Salil Pradhan.
2282,uCbgQzrg9fI.mp4,He's with the pediatric department at Valley.
2283,uCbgQzrg9fI.mp4,A wise Health Medical Center.
2284,uCbgQzrg9fI.mp4,Good morning to you.
2285,uCbgQzrg9fI.mp4,Good morning.
2286,uCbgQzrg9fI.mp4,Could you tell me more about this mysterious illness you say is connected to covid-19 with children.
2287,uCbgQzrg9fI.mp4,So we are listening to this one.
2288,uCbgQzrg9fI.mp4,Sure.
2289,uCbgQzrg9fI.mp4,So unfortunately before this all started we were thinking the kids weren't quite as affected covid-19 that's adults were which was a good thing but a New York started reporting some cases of this meat multi-system inflammatory syndrome.
2290,uCbgQzrg9fI.mp4,Over the past few weeks and then other states have reported as well.
2291,uCbgQzrg9fI.mp4,So it seems to be sort of a covid related.
2292,uCbgQzrg9fI.mp4,It's different from the other symptoms that covid-19 is causing.
2293,uCbgQzrg9fI.mp4,It seems to be specific to a certain degree to kids but it's something new that we're seeing with them and what are the symptoms?
2294,uCbgQzrg9fI.mp4,So at this point while the early symptoms may be similar to other covid-19 symptoms as far as runny nose and coughs and colds.
2295,uCbgQzrg9fI.mp4,It seems that they're presenting more with much more inflammatory case.
2296,uCbgQzrg9fI.mp4,So what we call shock where the body isn't perfusing the organs as well as it should with blood and oxygen.
2297,uCbgQzrg9fI.mp4,"They're having some other findings as far as heart disease, which is similar to some other inflammatory syndromes we have so it's more of an inflammation in the organs and in the blood vessels that we're seeing so our kids at home we start seeing them."
2298,uCbgQzrg9fI.mp4,Is it coughing?
2299,uCbgQzrg9fI.mp4,Is it respiratory?
2300,uCbgQzrg9fI.mp4,How will we notice I mean because it sounds more internal for the doctors and that's what you guys are seeing.
2301,uCbgQzrg9fI.mp4,But for a mom or dad what one should we be?
2302,uCbgQzrg9fI.mp4,"Arm and take our kids to the doctor's I think any time a kid presents with, you know, just not acting the same as far as activity certainly as far as not eating and drinking appropriately just seems really just run down."
2303,uCbgQzrg9fI.mp4,If you feel like they're the kids is not as active acting themselves.
2304,uCbgQzrg9fI.mp4,It's a good idea to at least call the physician's office at this point.
2305,uCbgQzrg9fI.mp4,We still we still are recommending calling ahead to the doctor's office rather than coming to the doctor's office just to make sure that the opposite is prepared.
2306,uCbgQzrg9fI.mp4,See your child.
2307,uCbgQzrg9fI.mp4,So certainly a phone call to the doctor.
2308,uCbgQzrg9fI.mp4,"If you notice, you know more than the usual cough gold loaf heaters kind of stuff if they really are not behaving themselves seem to be sicker than usual to go ahead and call the doctor."
2309,uCbgQzrg9fI.mp4,And is it unlike coronavirus where you can actually prescribe the children something to make the symptoms ease up or is this something you have to sit through like her on a virus know if you if it's really progressing to the multi-system inflammatory syndrome.
2310,uCbgQzrg9fI.mp4,They're seeing that that requires hospitalization.
2311,uCbgQzrg9fI.mp4,So certainly if a parent is worried that their kid is progressing to this disease process a phone call to the doctor's office or visit to the emergency department is warranted at that point because it does require hospitalization.
2312,uCbgQzrg9fI.mp4,"So Darlin evaluation in terms of our kids going back to school in the fall because I mean obviously they've been out for months now, so we're approaching the next school year."
2313,uCbgQzrg9fI.mp4,What does this mean now that you guys are seeing this in?
2314,uCbgQzrg9fI.mp4,Aaron I think it means we'd have to keep a close eye on the numbers that we're going to see over the summer time.
2315,uCbgQzrg9fI.mp4,I think it means that we're going to have to be vigilant for what's coming.
2316,uCbgQzrg9fI.mp4,It's hard to predict what's going to be happening in the fall.
2317,uCbgQzrg9fI.mp4,It's hard to predict weather affects whether we're other measures in place.
2318,uCbgQzrg9fI.mp4,And so it's hard to say that certainly I think we just need to keep a closer eye on it at this point.
2319,uCbgQzrg9fI.mp4,It's been very few cases or not a very large number of cases in so it's hard to make any he has of what's causing it what the treatment is what works best.
2320,uCbgQzrg9fI.mp4,We really don't know much about it because we haven't seen too many cases yet.
2321,uCbgQzrg9fI.mp4,"Yeah, so just stay aware."
2322,uCbgQzrg9fI.mp4,Keep a close eye on your kids as far as symptoms and how they're acting.
2323,uCbgQzrg9fI.mp4,We got it.
2324,uCbgQzrg9fI.mp4,Dr. Pratt and thank you so much for Valley wise Hospital.
2325,0yGDLtX7RGQ.mp4,"If you're coming home to somebody in your family who is higher risk, I would advise just taking extra precautions one is think about where you're going before you leave the home."
2326,0yGDLtX7RGQ.mp4,Do you need to do X Y or Z.
2327,0yGDLtX7RGQ.mp4,"If you do, okay fine, one of the things we've been doing in our family is getting more of doing the online ordering like you can go to like Walmart and online order and then they'll put it in the back of your car and then you can just kind of drive away."
2328,0yGDLtX7RGQ.mp4,So that's one way because as a physician I can't risk a And a quarantine I have to be here to work and so we're minimizing my contact more for the protection of my patients then then for our individual family.
2329,0yGDLtX7RGQ.mp4,But if you have someone in your household who is higher risk think about where you're going and where you absolutely need to go there.
2330,0yGDLtX7RGQ.mp4,And when you come home you need to before you interact with that person.
2331,0yGDLtX7RGQ.mp4,You need to wash your hands depending on the kind of exposure you're talking about.
2332,0yGDLtX7RGQ.mp4,Do you need to change your clothes or take a shower for me as a physician?
2333,0yGDLtX7RGQ.mp4,I do when my when my babies were very A little when my son was first born when I came home from work.
2334,0yGDLtX7RGQ.mp4,I would I would change clothes shower that way when I was holding him and hugging him.
2335,0yGDLtX7RGQ.mp4,"I wasn't worried about you know, that kind of contact."
2336,0yGDLtX7RGQ.mp4,"So it depends on the contact level that you have with the person in your home and what their immune status is, but I would definitely recommend hand hygiene before you interact with them."
2337,R8KFjSbbmsg.mp4,We're going to turn out to an i-team update a queen's Children's Hospital says it seemed a for it seen 40 cases of aware inflammatory syndrome that has a suspected link to covid-19.
2338,R8KFjSbbmsg.mp4,That's more than triple.
2339,R8KFjSbbmsg.mp4,The amount of patients the hospital previously reported News 4 investigator reporter Melissa Russo broke the story last week joins us live this afternoon in Murray Hill with an update Melissa.
2340,R8KFjSbbmsg.mp4,Stefan has more Doctors Hospitals and family members come forward to describe what they see as a new pattern of life-threatening inflammatory disease in children.
2341,R8KFjSbbmsg.mp4,It's really starting to bend the previously held perception that children do not get very sick from covid-19.
2342,R8KFjSbbmsg.mp4,When 12 year old Juliette daily got sick and went to a Louisiana hospital with stomach pain.
2343,R8KFjSbbmsg.mp4,Her.
2344,R8KFjSbbmsg.mp4,Mom did not suspect coronavirus.
2345,R8KFjSbbmsg.mp4,Her lips were blue in her arms were cold.
2346,R8KFjSbbmsg.mp4,"Juliet did test positive for covid-19 and her symptoms grew worse, her heart rate started dropping even more."
2347,R8KFjSbbmsg.mp4,It went from 40 to 2201.
2348,R8KFjSbbmsg.mp4,They called a code and they did two minutes of CPR on her and thank God.
2349,R8KFjSbbmsg.mp4,They're able to bring her back.
2350,R8KFjSbbmsg.mp4,"Thankfully Juliette is recovering now, but she's not alone doctors around the world and right here in our area are working urgently to understand a serious new inflammatory syndrome caused by covid-19 in children."
2351,R8KFjSbbmsg.mp4,We just admitted another to last night.
2352,R8KFjSbbmsg.mp4,"I have six in my Intensive Care Unit right now who fit this criteria, and what's most alarming things that can lead to severe heart and illness at Cohen Children's Hospital in Nassau County."
2353,R8KFjSbbmsg.mp4,T doctor started counting these cases about a week ago.

2357,R8KFjSbbmsg.mp4,So news shows like your own for real.
2358,R8KFjSbbmsg.mp4,Ali helping to get the word out there For several days now.
2359,R8KFjSbbmsg.mp4,I've been asking the city and the state Departments of Health for any information that they have on there so far.
2360,R8KFjSbbmsg.mp4,They have not been able to provide us with any numbers that could give us a sense of just how widespread this problem is in our area.
2361,R8KFjSbbmsg.mp4,We're live in Murray Hill Melissa Russo news for New York.
2362,D6H4YXoauuQ.mp4,"Hello, this is Pastor painting from the European Centre for disease prevention and control I wanted to say a few words over social media about our recent rapid risk assessments on the coronavirus covid-19 situation in Europe."
2363,D6H4YXoauuQ.mp4,The situation has evolved extremely rapidly in the past few weeks from a situation of some introductory introduced cases and clusters in Europe to a situation where several countries in Europe are facing.Healthcare pressures and big pressures in their intensive care at the moments.
2364,D6H4YXoauuQ.mp4,We talked about Northern Italy.
2365,D6H4YXoauuQ.mp4,We talked about Northeastern France.
2366,D6H4YXoauuQ.mp4,There are areas in Spain which are very close to being in this situation.
2367,D6H4YXoauuQ.mp4,"There are areas in southern Netherlands, which are really having difficulties with their intensive care capacities, but we're all in the same boat with this situation."
2368,D6H4YXoauuQ.mp4,If you look at the trajectory of the disease the way it Transmits from person to person through droplets or through direct contact.
2369,D6H4YXoauuQ.mp4,We see that this is essentially an exponential increase in all of the countries on these logarithmic scales.
2370,D6H4YXoauuQ.mp4,You see that the trajectory is the same across Europe countries suggest in different phases of evolution of this epidemic.
2371,D6H4YXoauuQ.mp4,"So in our risk assessments, we address the risk for European citizens we go."
2372,D6H4YXoauuQ.mp4,Cedar that for the general population the risk currently is moderate but for the populations in the high-risk groups the elderly and those with chronic underlying conditions the risk is very high.
2373,D6H4YXoauuQ.mp4,Currently.
2374,D6H4YXoauuQ.mp4,We advise European Union member states to take measures immediately these include Community mitigation measures such as social distancing measures and hand hygiene.
2375,D6H4YXoauuQ.mp4,Gene individual measures that that every single person can take this situation is going to take quite a long time.
2376,D6H4YXoauuQ.mp4,We're talking about weeks and months.
2377,D6H4YXoauuQ.mp4,So so people should be prepared for that and we will be updating the risk assessments as we get more information and evidence of this outbreak.
2378,D6H4YXoauuQ.mp4,Thank you for listening.
2379,D6H4YXoauuQ.mp4,And please visit our website to check the details of the risk assessments.
2380,ex-X0BknXY4.mp4,"Been talking all morning about the progress of reopening business and schools in some cases the lack of join us to break down in real time what the data looks like USA facts President popping McDonald Papi, it's great to have you on the program."
2381,ex-X0BknXY4.mp4,"You know, we had Steve Ballmer your founder on the program just a now probably about a month ago when we were talking about the disconnect between where the markets were and where the quote unquote real economy was and I wanted to talk and dig into that disconnect for the audience because I think you have some new data and numbers that put it in some context."
2382,ex-X0BknXY4.mp4,"Right, I would say it's still a bit of a mixed bag."
2383,ex-X0BknXY4.mp4,But retail sales are now up above pre-pandemic spending.
2384,ex-X0BknXY4.mp4,So that's positive cases are down.
2385,ex-X0BknXY4.mp4,"So if we look at comparing July and August, we had 1.4 million new cases in July as compared to 1.9 million with 31 states in the wash and Washington DC reporting cases down and and of start ups lately an 18 percent above in August as compared to July so I'm a bit of a mixed bag, but we're starting to see some progress."
2386,ex-X0BknXY4.mp4,"So Poppy the other piece of this is we've been talking about school re-openings all morning in large part because Bill de Blasio in New York City has now pushed back the school opening what is school openings look like in terms of the data that you now have on this look like around the country The View by the way, always was that you needed schools to be open for the economy to really re-engage and what's so interesting is it seems like the economy has re-engaged even before that necessarily been the case."
2387,ex-X0BknXY4.mp4,Right.
2388,ex-X0BknXY4.mp4,So we're seeing that with the 225 largest public schools.
2389,ex-X0BknXY4.mp4,Most of kids are going back online.
2390,ex-X0BknXY4.mp4,So about 10 and a half million of about sixteen point two million children including my own kids in Washington state who are back online.
2391,ex-X0BknXY4.mp4,"And so we are seeing things like, dr. Gottlieb talked about with restaurants opening before kids are being allowed to go back in person."
2392,ex-X0BknXY4.mp4,"I think we're probably most cautious when it comes to our youngest children, but as certainly discrepancy there Are you of the view that this this school piece which is so interesting that actually have more kids were able to go to school at school."
2393,ex-X0BknXY4.mp4,The economy would do even better than where we are given some like the retail numbers that you were you were alluding to before.
2394,ex-X0BknXY4.mp4,That's a great question.
2395,ex-X0BknXY4.mp4,Typically what we do at USA faxes.
2396,ex-X0BknXY4.mp4,We give people and Empower them with the data and allow them to make their own decisions.
2397,ex-X0BknXY4.mp4,"And so you've got kids going back online and you see that the retail sales are backup and a lot of that spending is happening Less in restaurants or in services and it's happening more in people who are buying things to enjoy the outdoors or in food sales, right?"
2398,ex-X0BknXY4.mp4,So how that will be Acted by kids going back to school.
2399,ex-X0BknXY4.mp4,We want Americans to look and say is that the right decision and we want you to be able to look by States and see how does the decision my state compared to others?
2400,ex-X0BknXY4.mp4,Poppy maybe this is a bit of a meta question.
2401,ex-X0BknXY4.mp4,"But in an age of misinformation and you're looking at you know, Facebook and Twitter putting in these policies around misinformation There's real questions up here about what the people believe the veracity of information your whole effort your whole, you know Enterprises about trying to put down the facts so that people can see what's going on."
2402,ex-X0BknXY4.mp4,But how concerned are you about the the fact that people don't believe the facts Definitely very concerned and USA facts started because we knew it was hard for people to get access to trusted information.
2403,ex-X0BknXY4.mp4,And we did as our state of the facts poll in 2019 with the Associated Press in Newark.
2404,ex-X0BknXY4.mp4,"And we ask people about their trust in local news and cable news in radio as well as in social media and we found that 54% The majority said that they go to social media at least once a day to get information, but only 11 percent."
2405,ex-X0BknXY4.mp4,Really trust that platform.
2406,ex-X0BknXY4.mp4,So that was the biggest Gap in terms of trust versus use was in social media and USA facts.
2407,ex-X0BknXY4.mp4,We believe the facts deserve to be heard and that's why we've become a destination where people can go and see by the numbers were non-partisan not-for-profit organization want to make that data accessible.
2408,aGUN2f-6v8U.mp4,I'm in such perfect shape doctors prescribed vitamin D to the US president as part of his treatment researchers noticed how people sick with covid-19 often had a deficiency.
2409,aGUN2f-6v8U.mp4,Is this a coincidence?
2410,aGUN2f-6v8U.mp4,Maybe maybe not this scientist is trying to find out with the launch of a new clinical trial in the UK using Vitamin D supplements.
2411,aGUN2f-6v8U.mp4,It boosts in eight antiviral immunity in the lining of the lung.
2412,aGUN2f-6v8U.mp4,And it also down regulates harmful inflammation and this combination of actions suggest that it might be a good candidate for covid-19 vitamin D has long been researched for other conditions and the results often falls short.
2413,aGUN2f-6v8U.mp4,This latest study from Spain has generated a lot of enthusiasm it found more than 80% of covid patients at One hospital were vitamin D deficient.
2414,aGUN2f-6v8U.mp4,The problem is they were also more likely to have hypertension and heart disease.
2415,aGUN2f-6v8U.mp4,Researchers admit that makes it hard to draw any conclusions.
2416,aGUN2f-6v8U.mp4,So I think there's reason to be skeptical about the value of vitamin D. But I think we have to be open-minded.
2417,aGUN2f-6v8U.mp4,We're in the middle of a pandemic right?
2418,aGUN2f-6v8U.mp4,We've got to try stuff about two-thirds of Canadians already get enough vitamin D from natural sources or supplements according to statistics Canada.
2419,aGUN2f-6v8U.mp4,So we'll taking extra protect you from covid-19.
2420,aGUN2f-6v8U.mp4,You probably don't need any supplemental vitamin D. You're getting plenty and in my opinion In the wrist would outweigh the benefits this pediatrician says that hasn't stopped parents from thinking they can boost their children's immune systems.
2421,aGUN2f-6v8U.mp4,I see some kids who are on a thousand units 2000 units and they're more susceptible to Vitamin D. It seems because they end up getting what we call hypercalcemia are peeing too much calcium and end up getting kidney stones and the treatment for too much vitamin D is simple enough.
2422,aGUN2f-6v8U.mp4,"Just stop taking it Vic adobea CBC News, Toronto."
2423,sR8vmBnp6qw.mp4,There's a lot of concern about the spread of coronavirus although covid-19 flu while there is some hype and scaremongering.
2424,sR8vmBnp6qw.mp4,The reality is that we will all have to change our behaviors for a short period of time firstly we have to take care of our physical health.
2425,sR8vmBnp6qw.mp4,We all need to exercise caution in our personal hygiene such as regularly washing our hands and using tissues.
2426,sR8vmBnp6qw.mp4,"If you are experiencing any of the symptoms associated with this virus, then follow the government'sAbout what to do do not go to your doctor's surgery Pharmacy or hospital and avoid contact with others in large social Gatherings to reduce the chances of spreading the virus secondly be aware that unscrupulous cyber criminals will be exploiting people's fear."
2427,sR8vmBnp6qw.mp4,We have already witnessed digital scams that attempt to steal money or infect unsuspecting victims systems with malware nowadays.
2428,sR8vmBnp6qw.mp4,It seems that medical viruses give rise to the spread of digital viruses.
2429,sR8vmBnp6qw.mp4,The advice is simple remain alert and take your time.
2430,sR8vmBnp6qw.mp4,If you receive any coronavirus messages pertaining to be from authorities such as the World Health Organization.
2431,sR8vmBnp6qw.mp4,Don't trust the link in these types of messages instead use your browser to access any information resources.
2432,sR8vmBnp6qw.mp4,"You are offered directly from a reliable source, and remember you're fishing e-learning as with all challenges remaining calm and thinking before you act is the best approach"
2433,IMXgcI1q2fs.mp4,Here closer to home with Thanksgiving and the start of holiday travel season upon us.
2434,IMXgcI1q2fs.mp4,A lot of us are wondering what do we do plan the trip to see family and friends or do we stay home with Governor Cuomo just changed New York's travel rules.
2435,IMXgcI1q2fs.mp4,So we will no longer have that 14-day quarantine list of states instead Travelers arriving in New York will have to quarantine for three days plus take covid test before and after they arrive now if you leave for less than 24 hours or you venture into one of our neighboring states the rules change.Used yet.
2436,IMXgcI1q2fs.mp4,Well news for Spacey Chang live at LaGuardia Airport to kind of clear things up for a Spacey.
2437,IMXgcI1q2fs.mp4,We're all ears.
2438,IMXgcI1q2fs.mp4,"Yeah, Natalie, you know if you are okay with taking multiple covid tests, then it could be easier for you to see your family this Thanksgiving."
2439,IMXgcI1q2fs.mp4,You don't have to quarantine for the 14 days but travel industry experts hope that these new rules will also give tourism a major boost.
2440,IMXgcI1q2fs.mp4,Inside a cavernous and empty LaGuardia Airport.
2441,IMXgcI1q2fs.mp4,We saw just a few Travelers like the Millers who are on their way to Miami.
2442,IMXgcI1q2fs.mp4,"We're going to have our masks on and hope for the best New York's mandatory 14 day quarantine policy from covid-19 hotspots has kept tourists away for some people being in quarantine for 14 days isn't the most realistic thing as coronavirus cases Spike Nationwide, including neighboring states Governor Cuomo adopted a new policy."
2443,IMXgcI1q2fs.mp4,And it's all about testing.
2444,IMXgcI1q2fs.mp4,Here's how it works.
2445,IMXgcI1q2fs.mp4,"If you're traveling from another state, you must test negative for covid within 3 days of coming to New York and then upon arrival quarantine for three days and get a negative test on the fourth Travelers out of state for less than 24 hours."
2446,IMXgcI1q2fs.mp4,Do not need to quarantine.
2447,IMXgcI1q2fs.mp4,But must get a test on day 4 of arrival back in New York.
2448,IMXgcI1q2fs.mp4,I don't think that the the governor should make it overly onerous and travel from one state to the next.
2449,IMXgcI1q2fs.mp4,It's not helping the economy.
2450,IMXgcI1q2fs.mp4,"Why not everyone supported the vigorous testing but tourism experts say this could be one way to get people to visit New York again since March 1st, New York state has lost 40 1.6 billion tourism related dollars."
2451,IMXgcI1q2fs.mp4,I think this opens the door significantly.
2452,IMXgcI1q2fs.mp4,I think this is provides a lot of clarity without diminishing the safety of New York State residents.
2453,IMXgcI1q2fs.mp4,Local Health departments are responsible for enforcement upon arriving in New York visitors must fill out a travel form and Health Inspectors will follow up with them.
2454,IMXgcI1q2fs.mp4,During their visit.
2455,IMXgcI1q2fs.mp4,I think it's much easier and I think it makes it much easier for everybody else.
2456,IMXgcI1q2fs.mp4,"I mean, I don't want to be home for two weeks."
2457,IMXgcI1q2fs.mp4,If I'm code-free.
2458,IMXgcI1q2fs.mp4,It's the smartest thing to quarantine.
2459,IMXgcI1q2fs.mp4,"I would say however, like I understand if people have their lives that they need to get to and just want to take the test."
2460,IMXgcI1q2fs.mp4,"And if you travel from neighboring states like Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Connecticut, you won't be subject to those same rules also states that don't have a lot of covid cases."
2461,IMXgcI1q2fs.mp4,This all takes effect on Wednesday.
2462,IMXgcI1q2fs.mp4,We're live from LaGuardia tonight Pei zhi Cheng news for New York.
2463,OiW2LurRKxQ.mp4,"The concern with Halloween is that kids are really excited when their trick-or-treating and then they may end up with groups of other children outside their household and in these groups, they wouldn't be able to social distance and then that might increase risk for transmission."
2464,OiW2LurRKxQ.mp4,I think it's possible.
2465,OiW2LurRKxQ.mp4,I just think it's going to be really challenging to do that.
2466,OiW2LurRKxQ.mp4,Especially when kids are excited and part of the excitement of Halloween is really being in the community in a member of care of your community and some will miss out on that.
2467,OiW2LurRKxQ.mp4,So the lowest risk way to trick-or-treat would be to do it with only members of your household your own family and keep separate from other groups.
2468,OiW2LurRKxQ.mp4,And then when you do visit other people's houses to trick-or-treat stay a distance like arm's length and then have brief interactions with them the brief.
2469,OiW2LurRKxQ.mp4,Actions are going to be low risk for transmission.
2470,OiW2LurRKxQ.mp4,It's really the prolonged face-to-face contact that you want to avoid.
2471,OiW2LurRKxQ.mp4,And you want to avoid being crowded in large groups.
2472,OiW2LurRKxQ.mp4,Remember that this is primarily transmitted via the respiratory route.
2473,OiW2LurRKxQ.mp4,"Now, there's theoretical risk from contact, but I think that's very low risk."
2474,OiW2LurRKxQ.mp4,So I'm not worried about touching candy and and those kind of issues.
2475,OiW2LurRKxQ.mp4,I think that's very low risk for transmission.
2476,OiW2LurRKxQ.mp4,So you need a face covering to act as an effective barrier and so the masks that are plastic and that have cutouts those won't work.
2477,OiW2LurRKxQ.mp4,So you would have to wear a mask a face covering in addition to the costume mask.
2478,OiW2LurRKxQ.mp4,I have real concerns if it's really feasible to go house to house and really maintain the social distancing with really excitable kids.
2479,OiW2LurRKxQ.mp4,So one thing to consider this here is to do it at home and you can do Halloween activities at home.
2480,OiW2LurRKxQ.mp4,Watch a classic Halloween movie with everybody and have nice Halloween foods to share you could do a modified like an Easter egg hunt except for Halloween and hide candy in the backyard and you can really up your game by making it maybe glow-in-the-dark treats that the kids can look for.
2481,l411tsjqAms.mp4,Following the global outbreak of the novel coronavirus covid-19.
2482,l411tsjqAms.mp4,Social distancing has become a necessary preventive measure to slow the spread of this easily transmitted virus millions of people our quarantine causing many to feel suddenly very isolated and alone.
2483,l411tsjqAms.mp4,Even during normal circumstances prolong isolation can be harmful.
2484,l411tsjqAms.mp4,It has been linked to heart disease depression dementia and even impaired immunity social isolation can also exaggerated pre-existing symptoms like anxiety depression and even panic So what can you do to stay connected and healthy while practicing social distancing first take care of your mental physical and psychological well-being while it's important to stay up to date on what's going on around you remember to also focus on the positive.
2485,l411tsjqAms.mp4,If you have negative thoughts our worries don't ignore them instead try acknowledging and accepting them and then discuss them with someone you trust.
2486,l411tsjqAms.mp4,"Breathing exercises mindfulness meditation and muscle relaxation can also help your mental physical and emotional state exercise exercise is another great way to take care of your physical and mental health while in Social isolation, even though you may not be able to go to the gym find ways to take walks stretch and stay active within your space."

2494,l411tsjqAms.mp4,If your work from home involves using a computer or phone try to get up and look away from your screen periodically.
2495,l411tsjqAms.mp4,Be mindful of unhealthy coping strategies during times of stress and even boredom.
2496,l411tsjqAms.mp4,It's easy to cope by turning to food and alcohol.
2497,l411tsjqAms.mp4,Keep in mind that over eating or drinking too much can lead to unhealthy and harmful habits.
2498,l411tsjqAms.mp4,If you find yourself turning to food and drink to cope try using other strategies like meditation taking a walk or calling a friend find the good believe it or not.
2499,l411tsjqAms.mp4,There can actually be benefits to staying home.
2500,l411tsjqAms.mp4,For instance.

2506,TRJLshgHuvQ.mp4,We want to make sure that you understand that what you're being tested for Lauren Thomas spoke with News 19 medical reporter Rosemarie belts.
2507,TRJLshgHuvQ.mp4,The number of covid-19 cases continues to rise in South Carolina.
2508,TRJLshgHuvQ.mp4,Do you heck encourage is that people continue to get tested but what tests are available I spoke with.
2509,TRJLshgHuvQ.mp4,Dr. Rosemarie belts are medical reporter who works as a cardiovascular perfusionist in a covid-19 unit went to concentrate on the Agnostic test before the coronavirus which is the swab test.
2510,TRJLshgHuvQ.mp4,And then we also have the antibody test and that's going to be an indicator.
2511,TRJLshgHuvQ.mp4,If you've contracted the virus the swab test which tests for the active covid-19 virus is a long Q-tip that goes up your nose.
2512,TRJLshgHuvQ.mp4,Dr. Belts says it should be swab for 15 to 20 seconds if you don't comfortable.
2513,TRJLshgHuvQ.mp4,"Yeah, but 15 to 20 seconds."
2514,TRJLshgHuvQ.mp4,I know we've been talking about that number happy birthday.
2515,TRJLshgHuvQ.mp4,It's going to probably feel longer than it.
2516,TRJLshgHuvQ.mp4,It's nothing that you should be afraid.
2517,TRJLshgHuvQ.mp4,"It's not a needle, you know, it's just like I said, it's a little uncomfortable but it's painless as for the antibody test that can be a blood sample, but it's important to do it at the right time."
2518,TRJLshgHuvQ.mp4,"It takes about seven days for the virus to sort of present in the body, but it takes about two weeks for the body to prefer to create antibodies."
2519,TRJLshgHuvQ.mp4,So if you take that test at a time where if you don't know when you were exposed you could have been Exposed but test negative because your body just hasn't had the time to build up antibodies.
2520,TRJLshgHuvQ.mp4,"Okay, so that that's the confusion with this test."
2521,TRJLshgHuvQ.mp4,There's still so much that the medical community doesn't know about the virus.
2522,TRJLshgHuvQ.mp4,"But if you're getting tested it's important to ask the right questions, make sure you know what you're getting tested for and don't be afraid to say, you know, these are my symptoms or I don't have symptoms."
2523,TRJLshgHuvQ.mp4,You know why you want to have the test of just ask questions?
2524,TRJLshgHuvQ.mp4,"No, you're getting tested for and even with all of that still."

2587,ODffu1oJxww.mp4,Being partisan by praising the president's opponent to beat the bombers.

2615,i-wWz_SUyb4.mp4,Being at home.
2616,i-wWz_SUyb4.mp4,All the time is so hard.
2617,i-wWz_SUyb4.mp4,I really miss all my friends from school.
2618,i-wWz_SUyb4.mp4,So many grown-ups have been talking about coronavirus and I have a lot of questions.
2619,i-wWz_SUyb4.mp4,questions I know I'm gonna call my friend Julia.
2620,i-wWz_SUyb4.mp4,She is a child life specialist at passing Bell children's hospital.
2621,i-wWz_SUyb4.mp4,She is a grown-up that I really trust and I bet she can help.
2622,i-wWz_SUyb4.mp4,Hello.
2623,i-wWz_SUyb4.mp4,"Hi, Julia."
2624,i-wWz_SUyb4.mp4,"Hi PJ, can you hear me?"
2625,i-wWz_SUyb4.mp4,Yeah.
2626,i-wWz_SUyb4.mp4,Hi.
2627,i-wWz_SUyb4.mp4,"Hello, Julia."
2628,i-wWz_SUyb4.mp4,Why are you wearing a mask?
2629,i-wWz_SUyb4.mp4,Thank you so much for reminding me.
2630,i-wWz_SUyb4.mp4,I'm gonna take it off right now because I'm by myself but wearing a mask is one thing that I'm doing to protect myself and everybody else from coronavirus.
2631,i-wWz_SUyb4.mp4,Coronavirus Juliet.
2632,i-wWz_SUyb4.mp4,That's exactly why I called you today.
2633,i-wWz_SUyb4.mp4,No way.
2634,i-wWz_SUyb4.mp4,Yes way.
2635,i-wWz_SUyb4.mp4,I've been hearing a ton about it and I have a lot of questions.
2636,i-wWz_SUyb4.mp4,I don't even know what coronavirus really is.
2637,i-wWz_SUyb4.mp4,I know there's so much information out there coronavirus is a new type of virus that's been causing people to get sick with something called covid-19.
2638,i-wWz_SUyb4.mp4,Have you heard about that?
2639,i-wWz_SUyb4.mp4,Uh-huh?
2640,i-wWz_SUyb4.mp4,Well what happens when you get sick from covid-19.
2641,i-wWz_SUyb4.mp4,So usually people who get covid-19 will have a fever and a cough and it might be a little bit hard for them to breathe most of the time people get better with just rest and Medicine by if they need a little bit extra help.
2642,i-wWz_SUyb4.mp4,They'll come to the hospital.
2643,i-wWz_SUyb4.mp4,"Well, I feel great."
2644,i-wWz_SUyb4.mp4,I don't have a cough or fever any green.
2645,i-wWz_SUyb4.mp4,So does that mean I can go back to school now?
2646,i-wWz_SUyb4.mp4,No right.
2647,i-wWz_SUyb4.mp4,"Now PJ, we're doing something called social distancing which means that we're staying away from people except for the people that we live with which is a great way to reduce the number of germs that are spread."
2648,i-wWz_SUyb4.mp4,So staying home is staying see exactly.
2649,i-wWz_SUyb4.mp4,"Oh, okay."
2650,i-wWz_SUyb4.mp4,What else can I do?
2651,i-wWz_SUyb4.mp4,So One of the biggest things that you can do is to wash your hands.
2652,i-wWz_SUyb4.mp4,Do you wash your hands?
2653,i-wWz_SUyb4.mp4,"Yeah, but do you wash your hands for 20 seconds 20 seconds?"
2654,i-wWz_SUyb4.mp4,"Yeah, that seems like a long time right?"
2655,i-wWz_SUyb4.mp4,Uh-huh.
2656,i-wWz_SUyb4.mp4,So my trick is that when I'm washing my hands I either saying happy birthday or the ABC's in my head two times and then that's 20 seconds.
2657,i-wWz_SUyb4.mp4,"Oh wow, or if you need to clean your hands and you don't have a sink around you can also use hand sanitizer good idea."
2658,i-wWz_SUyb4.mp4,"Okay, 20 seconds doesn't seem so hard now."
2659,i-wWz_SUyb4.mp4,It's Anything else I need to think about.
2660,i-wWz_SUyb4.mp4,"Yeah, definitely if you need to sneeze or cough do it in to your elbow instead of into your hands."
2661,i-wWz_SUyb4.mp4,This is a way to make sure that your germs that you sneeze or cough.
2662,i-wWz_SUyb4.mp4,Don't get into the air and make other people sick.
2663,i-wWz_SUyb4.mp4,Wow.
2664,i-wWz_SUyb4.mp4,This is a lot to remember PJ one more thing.
2665,i-wWz_SUyb4.mp4,Uh-huh.
2666,i-wWz_SUyb4.mp4,It's really important that you try not to touch your face.
2667,i-wWz_SUyb4.mp4,Why is that because touching your face is an easy way for germs to get from your hands into your nose or your mouth and then that can make you sick.
2668,i-wWz_SUyb4.mp4,"Oh, wow."
2669,i-wWz_SUyb4.mp4,"Okay, so if I stay home and I try my best to cough and sneeze into my elbows, that's right."
2670,i-wWz_SUyb4.mp4,And I washed my hands for 20 seconds any second and I'm not gonna touch my face actly that will all help stop the spread of coronavirus.
2671,i-wWz_SUyb4.mp4,"You've got it, okay."
2672,i-wWz_SUyb4.mp4,Huh?
2673,i-wWz_SUyb4.mp4,Thanks for talking to me Julia course.
2674,i-wWz_SUyb4.mp4,I had a lot of questions.
2675,i-wWz_SUyb4.mp4,I've been trying to stay busy at home and I'm doing school online but this is still really hard.
2676,i-wWz_SUyb4.mp4,I get really bored.
2677,i-wWz_SUyb4.mp4,Sometimes it can be hard to be at home.
2678,i-wWz_SUyb4.mp4,All of the time something that I've been doing is practicing self-care when I'm not at work.
2679,i-wWz_SUyb4.mp4,So what self-care that's something that I do just for myself and it makes my body and my mind feel A more relaxed if things are feeling stressful.
2680,i-wWz_SUyb4.mp4,Okay.
2681,i-wWz_SUyb4.mp4,So I like to do yoga or take my dog for a walk and sometimes the best self care is talking to the people that you love so I can call my family on the phone or have video chats with friends.
2682,i-wWz_SUyb4.mp4,Like I'm doing right now.
2683,i-wWz_SUyb4.mp4,"Oh, yeah."
2684,i-wWz_SUyb4.mp4,Okay.
2685,i-wWz_SUyb4.mp4,So I've been doing some of that at home too.
2686,i-wWz_SUyb4.mp4,That's great.
2687,i-wWz_SUyb4.mp4,I've also been coloring a lot because that helps me feel calm.
2688,i-wWz_SUyb4.mp4,Oh and if I start to get really overwhelmed I've been taking deep breaths.
2689,i-wWz_SUyb4.mp4,It's taking deep breaths is a great way to practice self-care.
2690,i-wWz_SUyb4.mp4,Should we take a deep breath together?
2691,i-wWz_SUyb4.mp4,"Oh, I like that idea."
2692,i-wWz_SUyb4.mp4,Okay ready?
2693,i-wWz_SUyb4.mp4,Mmm in And out I feel much more relaxed me to blow.
2694,i-wWz_SUyb4.mp4,"You know, what else?"
2695,i-wWz_SUyb4.mp4,I love to do Julia what I like to dance PJ.
2696,i-wWz_SUyb4.mp4,"I like to dance, too."
2697,i-wWz_SUyb4.mp4,I have a great idea.
2698,i-wWz_SUyb4.mp4,What is it?
2699,i-wWz_SUyb4.mp4,Let's say goodbye with a virtual dance party.
2700,i-wWz_SUyb4.mp4,That's it.
2701,i-wWz_SUyb4.mp4,Bye.
2702,i-wWz_SUyb4.mp4,Bye.
2703,i-wWz_SUyb4.mp4,"Bye, Julia."
2704,-aGUuA5aDic.mp4,I would be worried that I would die in a hospital setting with covid because people don't listen to disabled people in the hospital and reinforces this feeling of being kind of left behind and iced out of society.
2705,-aGUuA5aDic.mp4,We live in a world that's filled with ableism and biases against the disability Community disabled people's lives matter.
2706,-aGUuA5aDic.mp4,They deserve to live through this pandemic.
2707,-aGUuA5aDic.mp4,My name is Andrew Garza.
2708,-aGUuA5aDic.mp4,I'm a disability awareness consultant.
2709,-aGUuA5aDic.mp4,"I live with cerebral palsy, which means that I'm a wheelchair user."
2710,-aGUuA5aDic.mp4,I'm Emily Liddell.
2711,-aGUuA5aDic.mp4,I am 28 years old and I have a physical disability called Larson syndrome.
2712,-aGUuA5aDic.mp4,It's a genetic joint and muscle disorder.
2713,-aGUuA5aDic.mp4,And so I use a wheelchair to get around.
2714,-aGUuA5aDic.mp4,I have a sitting disability and it means that I can sit down for only a short amount of time.
2715,-aGUuA5aDic.mp4,Just fucking kills me and puts me in life interrupting pain.
2716,-aGUuA5aDic.mp4,I use a cane.
2717,-aGUuA5aDic.mp4,I can't you know walk fast.
2718,-aGUuA5aDic.mp4,I can't ruin.
2719,-aGUuA5aDic.mp4,Of course.
2720,-aGUuA5aDic.mp4,I can't dance not really.
2721,-aGUuA5aDic.mp4,I know a lot of people who have different types of disabilities who feel much the theme that I do where they're already used to various forms of social distancing or social isolation.
2722,-aGUuA5aDic.mp4,And because the world is not accessible to us.
2723,-aGUuA5aDic.mp4,My people people are freaking out about Florentine and disabled people or are not as much my day-to-day life so far in my apartment hasn't changed that much.
2724,-aGUuA5aDic.mp4,I get up.
2725,-aGUuA5aDic.mp4,I do some work on my computer watch some Netflix have from Zoom meetings.
2726,-aGUuA5aDic.mp4,I'm used to not seeing my friends at often.
2727,-aGUuA5aDic.mp4,I'm used to not going outside that often.
2728,-aGUuA5aDic.mp4,I'm used to not being touched that often.
2729,-aGUuA5aDic.mp4,I think is changed is wishing that I could go outside and go for a walk go for like a role in my wheelchair.
2730,-aGUuA5aDic.mp4,Since I'm home 98% of the time the only 2% I go out is for all my doctor's appointments.
2731,-aGUuA5aDic.mp4,I have so many doctors.
2732,-aGUuA5aDic.mp4,My life is doctor's appointments.
2733,-aGUuA5aDic.mp4,"I just live from one to the next so those being canceled as you know, honestly devastating and the only service that I regularly receive right now is physical therapy two to three times a week and for me that is a necessity to keep my body moving and flexible, but it's also a little bit scary because it means Having someone come into my house multiple times a week who could perhaps have been exposed to the coronavirus."
2734,-aGUuA5aDic.mp4,"They have put my Care on essential Services, which means that normally I would shower once a day."
2735,-aGUuA5aDic.mp4,"No, I'm being asked to shower every two to three days if care becomes less of an option for me my quality of living will decrease I think that social distancing policies have raised some pretty critical issues for the disability community and we're seeing more and more instances of ableism happen as a result of this pandemic and we need to be aware of that."
2736,-aGUuA5aDic.mp4,I don't really see the energy of solidarity with disabled people right now at all.
2737,-aGUuA5aDic.mp4,I see a lot of privilege and a lack of self-awareness around that in so many states.
2738,-aGUuA5aDic.mp4,They've been issuing guidance saying that in the case of triage.
2739,-aGUuA5aDic.mp4,Something to take into account is a person's disability status and that's really really scary Amira compromising the elderly can hear you and it's important that we don't discount their lives and how important they are.
2740,-aGUuA5aDic.mp4,If and when this passes and evil people are going to continue to be able to matter what during or after this time.
2741,-aGUuA5aDic.mp4,"We'll that accessibility will that access will that solidarity will that care extra push for care, you know still be around let us have work from home."
2742,-aGUuA5aDic.mp4,Let us have a good these accommodations.
2743,-aGUuA5aDic.mp4,I really truly believe that it is up to the government and it's up to corporations.
2744,-aGUuA5aDic.mp4,It's even up to small businesses to come up with a That doesn't leave anybody behind it proves more than ever that we need to be listening to disabled people.
2745,-aGUuA5aDic.mp4,This is probably temporary for a lot of to healthy people my life matters.
2746,-aGUuA5aDic.mp4,So social distance for me.

2749,Hq6A1oHd_U8.mp4,The tiny air sacs at the end called the alveoli are the main targets epithelial cells are like the safety Shields of the body forming a covering of all the body surfaces Unfortunately.
2750,Hq6A1oHd_U8.mp4,They are prime cellular targets of the novel coronavirus because of the AC e 2 receptors which act as entry points the virus then enters the cell using the spike.
2751,Hq6A1oHd_U8.mp4,"18 on its surface that binds on a receptor of the target cells viruses have their own genetic code, but they lack the Machinery to copy their DNA."
2752,Hq6A1oHd_U8.mp4,So once inside like a trojan horse the virus then hijacks and transform the cell into a viral protein making factory the infected cells now serve the virus synthesizing thousands and thousands of varville proteins and assembling them which are later than released to enslave more cells and continue the process as the infected cells die.
2753,Hq6A1oHd_U8.mp4,"They release proteins called cytokines and damage associated with Killer patterns cytokines are like the messenger proteins which act as a signal to activate the immune system then macrophages one of the most specialized cells in the immune system gets activated the macrophages then begin to secrete inflammatory cytokines, which results in the acute inflammation inside the lung to be specific."
2754,Hq6A1oHd_U8.mp4,They release il-1 il-6 and il-8 tnf-alpha and if'n Gamma these cytokines migrated to the capillaries.
2755,Hq6A1oHd_U8.mp4,That line the alveoli capillaries are the smallest blood vessels having endothelial lining compromise of endothelial cells the inflammatory cytokines increase the spaces between the endothelial cells causing the capillaries to leak as a fluid from the capillaries start accumulating inside the alveoli becomes difficult to breathe.
2756,Hq6A1oHd_U8.mp4,"This condition is known as pneumonia the inability to get enough oxygen into the lungs raises the risk for developing hypoxemia, where the blood oxygen level drops."
2757,Hq6A1oHd_U8.mp4,Carbon dioxide will start accumulating inside which is known as respiratory acidosis as there's an increase in the secretion of cytokines.
2758,Hq6A1oHd_U8.mp4,It will induce the expression of a very important molecule on the endothelial lining of the blood cells called vesicular cell adhesion protein this acts as a magnet that attracts neutrophils to the site of the injury inside the alveoli neutrophils are white blood cells whose main function is to kill and clean out the invading pathogens.
2759,Hq6A1oHd_U8.mp4,They kill the virus.
2760,Hq6A1oHd_U8.mp4,"By secreting protegees and reactive oxygen species, but it comes with a price which is the damage of the tissue itself."
2761,Hq6A1oHd_U8.mp4,"The cycle will repeat leading to more inflammation and more fluid accumulation type 1 alveolar cells, which are involved in the process of gas exchange between the alveoli and the blood are damaged."
2762,Hq6A1oHd_U8.mp4,Type 2 alveolar cells which are responsible for making the alveoli open also gets damaged as a result.
2763,Hq6A1oHd_U8.mp4,The alveoli will collapse which will further contribute to the hypoxemia Additionally the cytokine secreted by the macrophages will result in the microscopic clotting of platelets and red blood cells called micro thrombus or a blood clot.
2764,Hq6A1oHd_U8.mp4,This will lead to more hypoxemia and complete lung failure.
2765,Hq6A1oHd_U8.mp4,As these cytokines are secreted into the system circulation.
2766,Hq6A1oHd_U8.mp4,They will have a very bad effect causing abnormal blood clotting throughout the system blood clotting starts forming throughout the body blocking small blood vessels.
2767,Hq6A1oHd_U8.mp4,"This is known as disseminated intravascular coagulation, which is a serious Disorder."
2768,Hq6A1oHd_U8.mp4,So it all began with a nasty cold and viral pneumonia from acute respiratory distress syndrome.
2769,Hq6A1oHd_U8.mp4,It has progressed to pulmonary embolism and then ultimately led to multi-organ failure due to abnormal blood clotting throughout the body.
2770,Hq6A1oHd_U8.mp4,"It isn't the virus that kills you but the way that your body reacts or should I say fails to react against the virus that causes the death, although there is no 100% effective treatment as of yet."
2771,Hq6A1oHd_U8.mp4,We don't need to panic as stress is only going to help the virus develop more remember ninety-four percent of the patients recover from it despite the symptoms they show Make sure to thoroughly wash your hands with alcohol-based hand rubs or soaps avoid any physical contact and stay away from crowds.
2772,Hq6A1oHd_U8.mp4,"And if you have any symptoms remain calm and contact your local Health Services coronavirus really is not the end of the world, but we need to break the chain don't you think that our body is amazing constantly fighting off infection and disease comment below your thoughts and please subscribe for more wonderful videos."
2773,Hq6A1oHd_U8.mp4,Thank you so much for watching.
2774,Hq6A1oHd_U8.mp4,Stay.
2775,Hq6A1oHd_U8.mp4,Happy.
2776,Hq6A1oHd_U8.mp4,Stay healthy and stay curious.
2777,2fknMwWlgRA.mp4,"Price, we now need to turn to a major update on a story the news for I team was first to report a five year old boy in New York City has died from a rare inflammatory syndrome."
2778,2fknMwWlgRA.mp4,That's likely linked to covid-19 Governor Cuomo now says the state is investigating other deaths the iTunes Melissa rooster broke the story last week and joins us now with the latest Melissa tell us what else you're finding out Stefon.
2779,2fknMwWlgRA.mp4,Everybody is really learning about this as we go when we first reported back on April 28th at New York City hospitals were starting to see children presenting with severe in Inflammatory disease and even heart failure.
2780,2fknMwWlgRA.mp4,"Of course, we all hoped it wouldn't come to this but this syndrome impacting children has now proven fatal alarming for sure, but pediatricians insist most children are recovering."
2781,2fknMwWlgRA.mp4,It was scary.
2782,2fknMwWlgRA.mp4,It was scary.
2783,2fknMwWlgRA.mp4,I didn't think I was gonna make it out the same if at all 14 year old Jack McMorrow feels lucky to be alive after 10 days in the hospital with a mysterious illness now believed to be caused by covid-19.
2784,2fknMwWlgRA.mp4,It started with a fever and a rash.
2785,2fknMwWlgRA.mp4,"It was painful as it was scary and I like I I just pray that it doesn't happen anyone else, but it is happening Governor Andrew Cuomo announcing They the state now knows of at least seventy three children hospitalized with what they're calling multi-system inflammatory syndrome tragically at least one child has died."
2786,2fknMwWlgRA.mp4,"This is every parent's nightmare right that your child may actually be affected by this virus, but it's something we have to consider."
2787,2fknMwWlgRA.mp4,Seriously now Mount Sinai.
2788,2fknMwWlgRA.mp4,Kravis Children's Hospital confirms the child who died yesterday was a five year old boy.
2789,2fknMwWlgRA.mp4,"Boy in their care the governor says the state is also investigating additional deaths of children, including one in Westchester involving a seven-year-old boy something that every parent who has children at home should pay close attention to this is very serious."
2790,2fknMwWlgRA.mp4,This disease can be fatal.
2791,2fknMwWlgRA.mp4,So caution to all people who again may have believed that their child couldn't be affected by covid in Jack's case.
2792,2fknMwWlgRA.mp4,He was never sick with covid-19.
2793,2fknMwWlgRA.mp4,19 but he tested positive for the antibodies symptoms include prolonged fever for several days vomiting and diarrhea rash and swollen hands and feet.
2794,2fknMwWlgRA.mp4,Jack says the scariest part was watching his terrified father at the hospital get down on his knees.
2795,2fknMwWlgRA.mp4,He definitely got on his hands and knees and was praying the just praying that I'd even make it out of there alive and that's why I wanted to do the interview because I don't want anyone else.
2796,2fknMwWlgRA.mp4,Has to go through what I went through that that me.
2797,2fknMwWlgRA.mp4,I want to thank Jack Jack McMorrow for sharing his story with us.
2798,2fknMwWlgRA.mp4,He says that after 10 days in the hospital his home right now Feels Like Heaven.
2799,2fknMwWlgRA.mp4,"He says he gave his mom a huge hug and he came forward and talk to us because he wants other kids and parents to take any symptoms like fever rash vomiting swollen hands and feet very seriously, Natalie."
2800,dExSGsWITEY.mp4,"Since the start of the pandemic we've learned so much about the risk factors for developing severe illness from covid-19, but the list includes so many things race age symptoms other medical problems and so on so it's hard to know exactly how much each one might impact your risk."
2801,dExSGsWITEY.mp4,Dr. Frank McGeorge is here though with a new online tool to help anyone figure it out and it's free.
2802,dExSGsWITEY.mp4,This online tool was actually built to calculate a person's risk of requiring hospitalization.
2803,dExSGsWITEY.mp4,"After they were diagnosed with covid-19, but as your risk for being hospitalized increase, so does your risk for developing severe illness for anyone with covid-19."
2804,dExSGsWITEY.mp4,"This can provide some insight into the severity of your situation using data from over 4,500 patients treated at Cleveland Clinic sites in Cleveland in Florida researchers have developed an online risk prediction model to help identify which patients who have tested positive for covid-19 are most likely to be hospitalized the study identified."
2805,dExSGsWITEY.mp4,Several risk factors that have not been seen in other models former smokers were more likely to be hospitalized than current smokers certain medications like NSAIDs were associated with a higher risk of hospitalization.
2806,dExSGsWITEY.mp4,And race is a factor African-Americans are more likely to require hospitalization.
2807,dExSGsWITEY.mp4,Let's put some information into the model and see how much each factor changes your risk say.
2808,dExSGsWITEY.mp4,You're a 50 year old white woman without any significant medical problems who's never smoked and is only experiencing a fever.
2809,dExSGsWITEY.mp4,Her risk of being hospitalized is only three point one percent and a man in the same circumstance.
2810,dExSGsWITEY.mp4,"It's 4.1% if he's black he would face a higher 4.9% risk, but what if we add more symptoms fever shortness of breath and fatigue now, his risk has gone to nearly 19% and if he's overweight with diabetes the risk jumps to 32% and if you are an overweight 65 year old black man with diabetes and high blood pressure on NSAIDs."
2811,dExSGsWITEY.mp4,You have a A 50 percent chance of requiring hospitalization.
2812,dExSGsWITEY.mp4,Now this online tool is really designed for doctors.
2813,dExSGsWITEY.mp4,But I honestly think anyone can use it to get an idea of how your individual situation might be different from someone else's now I would have course caution.
2814,dExSGsWITEY.mp4,It's only an estimate and I'm sure it will go through further refinement and validation over time the link to the site is on the Health page of clickondetroit.com back to you.
2815,0GHoKSBGbUg.mp4,Everybody's talking about covid-19 cases and a sad fact is that the numbers are increasing in India and other countries as well.
2816,0GHoKSBGbUg.mp4,In fact our top medical body the icmr has even said that it now seems that 80% people could be asymptomatic which means not immediately visible e showing any symptoms.
2817,0GHoKSBGbUg.mp4,"So in case you do think that you have symptoms of covid-19, what is it that you can do while you're At home, we have prepared some of these pointers for you."
2818,0GHoKSBGbUg.mp4,First stay at home.
2819,0GHoKSBGbUg.mp4,Do not go and visit public places.
2820,0GHoKSBGbUg.mp4,But if you feel that you even have slight symptoms that it is important that you stay at home.
2821,0GHoKSBGbUg.mp4,Do not leave your home except to get medical care Point number to isolate yourself from other family members and pet animals if you have so what does this mean that this needs try and not you shared items try and use different spaces for yourself.
2822,0GHoKSBGbUg.mp4,Third and most important monitor the symptoms that you're facing if you develop emergency warning signs from covid-19.
2823,0GHoKSBGbUg.mp4,Then you get medical attention immediately.
2824,0GHoKSBGbUg.mp4,You must not just sit back at home thinking it will recover by itself emergency warnings.
2825,0GHoKSBGbUg.mp4,What are these signs?
2826,0GHoKSBGbUg.mp4,They include one trouble breathing persistent pain or pressure in the chest area importantly are your lips of face changing color?
2827,0GHoKSBGbUg.mp4,Is it at any level turning blue?
2828,0GHoKSBGbUg.mp4,Is there a bluish tint on your face or Lips that's an emergency sign while you do want to visit your doctor call before you head out to the hospital or the concerned Clinic fix a prior appointment.
2829,0GHoKSBGbUg.mp4,Maybe by a telemedicine also already via video conferencing.
2830,0GHoKSBGbUg.mp4,You already have that option and you don't even have to venture out while you head out or you have you're forced to go out cover your face and mouth.
2831,0GHoKSBGbUg.mp4,Please ensure that you're taking precautions while coughing and sneezing.
2832,0GHoKSBGbUg.mp4,You do not want that virus spreading to other people.
2833,0GHoKSBGbUg.mp4,So what do you do cover your mouth and nose?
2834,0GHoKSBGbUg.mp4,"With a tissue when you cough or sneeze throw these used tissues immediately in a trash can please clean your hands constantly at regular intervals, which means wash your hands after blowing your nose coughing sneezing going to the lavatory before eating or preparing food avoid touching your eyes nose and mouth with unwashed hands avoid sharing your utensils and items with other family members."
2835,0GHoKSBGbUg.mp4,That's very important.
2836,0GHoKSBGbUg.mp4,You have to isolate yourself.
2837,0GHoKSBGbUg.mp4,So if you are in a sick Russo to Surf your house That our sofas is that have been touched they need to be disinfected.
2838,0GHoKSBGbUg.mp4,It is imperative that you keep cleaning and disinfecting those Services.
2839,0GHoKSBGbUg.mp4,"Let someone else clean and disinfect if you if you can't but at least in your bedroom in the room that you have restricted yourself, that should be cleaned only by you."
2840,0GHoKSBGbUg.mp4,"And now in some good news, you think your symptoms are over you want to now get out of your house."
2841,0GHoKSBGbUg.mp4,You want to go out for a walk?
2842,0GHoKSBGbUg.mp4,You want to go out to a public place and end your house isolation.
2843,0GHoKSBGbUg.mp4,So how do you discontinue your home isolation?
2844,0GHoKSBGbUg.mp4,Here are some points people with covid-19 who have stayed home or our home isolated can stop that whom isolation only under these condition or at Best?
2845,0GHoKSBGbUg.mp4,"Of course, if somehow you can get a test done to ensure that you do not have covid-19 anymore you can then Your home but importantly your fever needs to go down that is one of the most visible signs."
2846,0GHoKSBGbUg.mp4,If you've had no fever for at least 72 hours that is three full days of no fever without the use of medicines other symptoms have improved.
2847,0GHoKSBGbUg.mp4,Let's say you're not feeling shortness of breath anymore.
2848,0GHoKSBGbUg.mp4,You're not feeling cough or sneezing anymore.
2849,0GHoKSBGbUg.mp4,That's also good sign and importantly at least seven days need to have passed since you've started feeling the symptoms.
2850,0GHoKSBGbUg.mp4,You can be at home if you take all those proper precautions and do not spread it to anybody else and isolate yourself.
2851,KAZ35qIm_JI.mp4,China has offered a helping hand to Iran as Hosea mentioned briefly by sending medical experts to tear ran to help the fight against the outbreak the medical team discussed with who experts and deranian offer shows a sharing their clinical experience with some main hospitals in tear on the role of quarantine patient treatment and a pathogen monitoring top to their discussion.
2852,KAZ35qIm_JI.mp4,"The team also brought part of China's Medical Supply Aid Iran it is short ofrelated equipment right now Medusa turning out to undo letter, you know."
2853,KAZ35qIm_JI.mp4,Our team has brought about some medical supplies to Iran including detection kits and ventilators.
2854,KAZ35qIm_JI.mp4,The kids have been sent to institut Pasteur for parallel tests.
2855,KAZ35qIm_JI.mp4,Once the tests are passed.
2856,KAZ35qIm_JI.mp4,They can be widely used in the detection of covid-19 patients.
2857,KAZ35qIm_JI.mp4,Now they eat only you can follow me Hannah woman cut China shares similar feelings as the epidemic breaks out in ground.
2858,KAZ35qIm_JI.mp4,We are friends indeed and it will have always helped each other the epidemic cannot stop us from developing our friendship and our ties will flourish even more.
2859,_bUy6XOc5kY.mp4,"Bingham recently gone through the process of Contracting this coronavirus luckily with relatively mild symptoms and I find myself on the other side of the illness, but still in know Lester state of social distance and undone General isolation."
2860,_bUy6XOc5kY.mp4,As you're learning is a strange frustrating and often distressing experience.
2861,_bUy6XOc5kY.mp4,"I thought I was you know, definitely gonna see the worst of it as an asthmatic, but thankfully I came through and you can too yes or some uplifting messages from two very famous faces who are diagnosed with covid-19 and are now doing okay now after being diagnosed with the virus Prince Charles was in self quarantine with wife Camilla in Scotland, but he's now passed UK guidelines of seven days of self-isolation."
2862,_bUy6XOc5kY.mp4,No interest album was diagnosed on March 16th in New Mexico while he was shooting a new Netflix project.
2863,_bUy6XOc5kY.mp4,So he went Sabrina got a lot of criticism in that video where he announced his diagnosis because obviously you can see that Sabrina is sitting right beside him.
2864,_bUy6XOc5kY.mp4,Now.
2865,_bUy6XOc5kY.mp4,She said she made the choice to be with her husband and she actually ended up Contracting it as well.
2866,_bUy6XOc5kY.mp4,But did your says now they're both doing fine.
2867,_bUy6XOc5kY.mp4,They're both doing.
2868,_bUy6XOc5kY.mp4,"Okay still asymptomatic, and we've tossed a quarantine period but we're a little bit stuck in limbo."
2869,_bUy6XOc5kY.mp4,We can't get a flight back home.
2870,_bUy6XOc5kY.mp4,So we just have to sit still for a little bit.
2871,_bUy6XOc5kY.mp4,"But other than That or okay, and we're so thankful for that."
2872,_bUy6XOc5kY.mp4,I think the worst of it is.
2873,_bUy6XOc5kY.mp4,It's probably past.
2874,_bUy6XOc5kY.mp4,Yeah.
2875,_bUy6XOc5kY.mp4,It just said he definitely had concerns about how hard this is going to hit him because he has asthma and of course Prince Charles is 71 so there was increased worried there.
2876,_bUy6XOc5kY.mp4,"But yeah, they're both doing okay and then both videos the guys wanted to make sure they shared it out the hospital staff and the Frontline workers that are helping us all in these trying times at such an unprecedented an anxious time in all our lives."
2877,_bUy6XOc5kY.mp4,My wife and I thinking particularly of all those who have lost loved ones in such very difficult and abnormal circumstances.
2878,_bUy6XOc5kY.mp4,"Just a big shout-out to everyone that's like helping other people, especially the doctors and nurses and Healthcare people that are doing their thing you are amazing and should be fully appreciated thoughts and prayers are very much with those markers people whose extraordinary skills and utter selfishness."
2879,_bUy6XOc5kY.mp4,Devotion to duty and the care of their patients make her so very proud indeed.
2880,_bUy6XOc5kY.mp4,It has been so wonderful to see just how many across the United Kingdom have signed up in that hundreds of thousands to be NHS volunteers offering their help to do whatever they can to provide support to those on the front line.
2881,_bUy6XOc5kY.mp4,"There are this is going to be a tough time for everyone but you know, I mean, don't try and keep your head up, basically."
2882,_bUy6XOc5kY.mp4,All right.
2883,_bUy6XOc5kY.mp4,But none of us can say when this will end but ended will.

2886,W8bTikEQk_M.mp4,My name is dr. Sonya Rasmussen.
2887,W8bTikEQk_M.mp4,I'm a pediatrician and I'm a mom and I know that there are a lot of questions right now.
2888,W8bTikEQk_M.mp4,The parents in particular have about covid-19 covid-19 is an abbreviation for Coronavirus 19.
2889,W8bTikEQk_M.mp4,It's a new virus that emerged in China in December of this last year and it spread very quickly throughout the world.Thus far it seems like children are more mildly affected but we only have very limited data from China right now.
2890,W8bTikEQk_M.mp4,What we don't know is what about children with underlying conditions children with asthma children with neurological conditions children with lung disease.
2891,W8bTikEQk_M.mp4,We don't have a lot of information about how covid-19 affects those people right now.
2892,W8bTikEQk_M.mp4,"Luckily, I think we've all heard the public health message teach your children to wash their hands saying happy birthday twice while fully using soap around all aspects of your finger rubbing your thumbs together and then rinse off and dry with a clean towel teach them to cough into their elbow teach them not to touch their face and most importantly teach them not to touch their friends at this moment."
2893,W8bTikEQk_M.mp4,This is very hard for kids kids are very social keep social distance to the to the point of not doing play dates.
2894,W8bTikEQk_M.mp4,I'm going to take a strict line on this and say that children really shouldn't be interacting with other children.
2895,W8bTikEQk_M.mp4,I know that's really hard.
2896,W8bTikEQk_M.mp4,"I know that personally and I'm getting lots of phone calls at work, but it's something that I think if we can do this for the short term, we'll all be able to celebrate later."
2897,W8bTikEQk_M.mp4,"We know that there are a lot of questions out there parents are concerned for their children for their parents for their grandparents, and we know there are a lot of questions and so we've opened up a new email address where you can reach us, please send your questions there and we'll answer them in a future video."
2898,W8bTikEQk_M.mp4,EO thank you so much.
2899,mDRKT4JrBAM.mp4,"It's um sometime protective measures against coronavirus covid-19 washing hands frequently washing your hands with an alcohol base sanitizer kills viruses and fuss stops the spread of covid-19 maintaining social distancing when someone infected with covid-19 coughs or sneezes, they spy small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain the virus.Social distancing is deliberately increasing the physical space between people to avoid spreading illness avoid touching your eyes nose and mouth as our hands touch many surfaces."
2900,mDRKT4JrBAM.mp4,We met accidentally pick viruses from there.
2901,mDRKT4JrBAM.mp4,"Now if we touch our eyes nose or mouth, we may transfer the virus the virus can enter our body from there and get us infected practice respiratory hygiene an infected person can help protect people."
2902,mDRKT4JrBAM.mp4,People around him if he practices respiratory hygiene like covering his mouth and nose with his bent elbow while coughing or sneezing coronavirus Mets.
2903,mDRKT4JrBAM.mp4,Myth number one eating Garlic can help avoid infection consuming garlic has its advantages but as per who it does not protect us from covid-19.
2904,mDRKT4JrBAM.mp4,Hmm.
2905,mDRKT4JrBAM.mp4,Myth number two drink water every 15 minutes.
2906,mDRKT4JrBAM.mp4,There's no evidence to suggest that this virus can be flushed out of the system by drinking a lot of water.
2907,mDRKT4JrBAM.mp4,Hmm.
2908,mDRKT4JrBAM.mp4,Myth number three don't eat ice cream.
2909,mDRKT4JrBAM.mp4,It is being believed that not eating cold food and first keeping the body heated will make it difficult for the virus to survive.
2910,mDRKT4JrBAM.mp4,This is not true.
2911,mDRKT4JrBAM.mp4,Hmm.
2912,mDRKT4JrBAM.mp4,Myth number four drinkable silver.
2913,mDRKT4JrBAM.mp4,Some are suggesting drinking tiny particles of silver see Ended in liquid it is risky to do so and it is not shown to cure covid-19 nor boost our immunity myth number five holding breath.
2914,mDRKT4JrBAM.mp4,"If a person can hold breath for more than 10 seconds, then one can avoid infection experts say this is simply not true."
2915,mDRKT4JrBAM.mp4,Hmm myth number six use of vodka as a hand sanitizer.
2916,mDRKT4JrBAM.mp4,This is not true because it does not contain enough alcohol to kill the virus.
2917,mDRKT4JrBAM.mp4,"What is a coronavirus it is an alien, which is hunting all of us."
2918,mDRKT4JrBAM.mp4,"Oh, um some coronavirus has our large family of viruses."
2919,mDRKT4JrBAM.mp4,They're found in animals as well as humans.
2920,mDRKT4JrBAM.mp4,Some of them are known to infect people and cause illnesses such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome as in Merce and severe acute respiratory syndrome as in SARS novel coronavirus or 2019 - n Co V is a new strain of coronavirus which was first detected in Wuhan China in December 2019.
2921,mDRKT4JrBAM.mp4,The disease caused by novel coronavirus is named as C OV ID - 19 here.
2922,mDRKT4JrBAM.mp4,Co and VI are taken from the word coronavirus while deep stands for disease and 19 stands.
2923,mDRKT4JrBAM.mp4,As for year 2019 some people might suffer from mild symptoms like runny nose sore throat cough and fever because of the virus while some might experience severe symptoms leading to pneumonia for some people.
2924,mDRKT4JrBAM.mp4,This disease has also proven to be fatal research is still on but the animal source of the novel coronavirus has not yet been identified.
2925,mDRKT4JrBAM.mp4,Why is it hard to cure common cold cuz common cold Is an invisibility cloak?
2926,mDRKT4JrBAM.mp4,"No, huh?"
2927,mDRKT4JrBAM.mp4,"Firstly, there are more than 200 viruses which caused common cold now developing 200 vaccines for 200 viruses is Impractical secondly developing a single vaccine for all 200 viruses is proving to be complex time-consuming and expensive as a lot of R&D is required."
2928,mDRKT4JrBAM.mp4,Thirdly.
2929,mDRKT4JrBAM.mp4,"We can't make antivirals to kill viruses just like we make X to kill bacteria why because antibiotics attack the bacteria's protective cell walls, but as viruses don't have any cell wall antivirals will be useless."
2930,mDRKT4JrBAM.mp4,"However, there might be some good news."
2931,mDRKT4JrBAM.mp4,Now a virus survives in human body by hijacking of protein found in human cells researchers have developed a compound which inhibits the virus from doing so but as the compound targets human cells more research is needed to test its safety.
2932,mDRKT4JrBAM.mp4,Should we work out when we have cold?
2933,mDRKT4JrBAM.mp4,We should just chill and have milk shakes you wish.
2934,mDRKT4JrBAM.mp4,Yes one may work out but for shorten duration and with reduced intensity of symptoms are above the neck as in common cold stuffy nose sneezing or jaw pain as the symptoms are minor one can take appropriate whole related medicines and then put in mild exercise with proper care note that light or moderate physical activity.
2935,mDRKT4JrBAM.mp4,Activity may help open up the nasal passageway.
2936,mDRKT4JrBAM.mp4,Thus helping us feel better.
2937,mDRKT4JrBAM.mp4,"But on the flip side, there is a chance of spreading germs or viruses to others on the other hand if the symptoms are below the neck as in Fever vomiting coughs shortness of breath etcetera, then one should not exercise."
2938,mDRKT4JrBAM.mp4,Our body needs rest in this case.
2939,mDRKT4JrBAM.mp4,Hence one should not overwork as it will make it difficult to recover and may also lead to fatigue or dizziness.

3081,W_KrxSUKVg8.mp4,It's roughly the same progress Canada made in the last decades through stringent regulations on vehicle emissions.
3082,W_KrxSUKVg8.mp4,It's pretty substantial.
3083,W_KrxSUKVg8.mp4,"We generally don't see these sort of Fairly sudden changes in emissions like that but scientists say that positive change towards cleaner air won't last long, unless Society shift towards a work from home climate sticks around and work from home work and And in that case you need to drive to work as often and will that and itself result in more long-term emissions reductions as governments look to restart the economy and help millions of unemployed Canadians."

3090,Z1-xcL5qz_g.mp4,We would all know is a respiratory Condition.
3091,Z1-xcL5qz_g.mp4,It's a it's a virus without in treatment at the moment.
3092,Z1-xcL5qz_g.mp4,And therefore the symptoms can be mocked can range from very mild to very severe that require hospitalization and it very much depends on the type of person.
3093,Z1-xcL5qz_g.mp4,You are your level of fitness and your age that really determines whether it's going to impact you severely or not but the most important thing particularly have others.Condition like lung cancer is to seek help and speak to your health Healthcare professional support team to get advice on what you should do including whether you need various vaccines for the flu or pneumonia as well.
3094,Z1-xcL5qz_g.mp4,So importantly covid-19.

3097,auISvRDHo3g.mp4,So as we all know there's a new coronavirus that's circulating in the world and causing a pandemic across the whole globe and a lot of people are worried about how can we keep our families safe right here in Missouri as a parent myself.
3098,auISvRDHo3g.mp4,I am also thinking about these same questions so far the one bright spot about covid-19 appears to be that children do not appear to be very severely affected.
3099,auISvRDHo3g.mp4,It is definitely possible that children are getting this infection and do not have a lot of symptoms and are still spreading to other people so they may have much more mild symptoms.
3100,auISvRDHo3g.mp4,Seems most of the strategies to keep your family safe from covid-19 are actually the same strategies that you follow to keep your family safe from influenza every year.
3101,auISvRDHo3g.mp4,So everyone should be washing their hands a lot using hand sanitizer a lot every time you and your family come back to your house from being out and about make it a habit to send everyone straight to the sink to wash their hands with soap and water you can talk to your kids school and be sure that they have hand sanitizer available for kids at school and they may also consider having wipes available for kids.
3102,auISvRDHo3g.mp4,Wipe down their desks periodically during the day as well.
3103,auISvRDHo3g.mp4,We know kids are not good about not touching their face and not touching anything they want to so it's important that they keep cleaning their hands frequently another important strategy to protect your family and to protect other families is to keep children who are sick at home.
3104,auISvRDHo3g.mp4,"So if your kid develops cold symptoms runny nose, cough fever."
3105,auISvRDHo3g.mp4,Keep them home from school and keep them home from other locations where they might be exposed to lots of other kids or two other adults covid-19.
3106,auISvRDHo3g.mp4,18 infection is still very rare in Missouri right now.
3107,auISvRDHo3g.mp4,"So if your child has any of these symptoms, it is more likely that they have influenza or some other respiratory virus."
3108,auISvRDHo3g.mp4,"If you are concerned about your child's health, the best thing to do is to call your pediatrician don't go straight to your pediatricians office without calling because they may want to put in place protections to keep other people in their waiting room and their own staff safe and protected from a possible infection and don't go straight to the emergency room either unless your child is having a a medical emergency in which case of course go straight to the emergency room."
3109,auISvRDHo3g.mp4,But if you are just worried or have questions or you're not sure what's going on start with your pediatrician call them on the phone and talk to them about what the next best steps are for your child.
3110,U4Nx69IOFwY.mp4,"Now the virus that were talking about having to do, you know, a lot of people think that goes away in April with the heat as the heat comes in."
3111,U4Nx69IOFwY.mp4,Typically that will go away in April.
3112,U4Nx69IOFwY.mp4,We're in great shape though.

3161,Xmbl7GcGxwI.mp4,"As the novel coronavirus continues to spread more and more cities are escalating their tactics to keep the virus at Bay asking people to socially distance and in some cases to shelter in place, but some are not so lucky to have the ability to work from home."
3162,Xmbl7GcGxwI.mp4,Dr. Eric Choi Pena an Emergency Physician and the director of global health for northwell health gave us some tips for staying safe at work and number one thing.
3163,Xmbl7GcGxwI.mp4,To do is wash your hands either 20 seconds with soap and water or with a hand sanitizer.
3164,Xmbl7GcGxwI.mp4,That's greater than 60% alcohol because the main mode of transmission is going to be touching surfaces that someone is coughed or sneezed on and then touching your face.
3165,Xmbl7GcGxwI.mp4,So that's your first line of defense is hand-washing.
3166,Xmbl7GcGxwI.mp4,So comparing hand sanitizer the soap and water if you have the ability to use soap and water that's your best bet.
3167,Xmbl7GcGxwI.mp4,"So hand sanitizers are quick way to disinfect your hands in between soap and water washes, but soap and water really does have greater efficacy in Way droplets washing away viral particles and removing any soil or contaminants on your hands where virus could be hitting underneath the hand sanitizer essentially is a superficial clean."
3168,Xmbl7GcGxwI.mp4,"So if you've got no dirt and Grime on your hands and use hand sanitizer, it is effective at killing most things that are on your hands."
3169,Xmbl7GcGxwI.mp4,But any time you have any type of dirt or anything else for something to be hiding underneath that layer of dirt hand sanitizer isn't going to get it but water and soak will I also recommend at the beginning of the day wiping down areas that you're going to Tha Soft in your work area.
3170,Xmbl7GcGxwI.mp4,So keyboards phones Mouse I would disinfect with it any any householder or businesses that I think would work one of the other ways to catch the virus is to be in close contact with other people being next to another human being for greater than two minutes within six feet who's sick and showing symptoms definitely is a risk.
3171,Xmbl7GcGxwI.mp4,"The idea right now is we want to practice some social distancing between people so that if someone is sick, we're not within six feet of them as much as possible."
3172,Xmbl7GcGxwI.mp4,"The other thing is avoiding Gatherings of greater than 5 People that aren't absolutely essential to business is probably a good a good temporary measure but social distancing is not always feasible, especially when your work involves person-to-person contact."
3173,Xmbl7GcGxwI.mp4,So the service industry is a tough area and if they're especially tough because they also don't have any sick time often if they don't work.
3174,Xmbl7GcGxwI.mp4,They're not making money.
3175,Xmbl7GcGxwI.mp4,So that's something that Society is in general.
3176,Xmbl7GcGxwI.mp4,"We have to take a look at because you know, they really do have kind of a financial imperative to work through all sick to the worst thing someone in the services."
3177,Xmbl7GcGxwI.mp4,Industry could do is work while sick but the things that they can do to protect themselves disinfect their hands.
3178,Xmbl7GcGxwI.mp4,"Make sure that every time the touching someone else's credit card touching a check touching touching something that another human being is taxed in the course of their job that before they do anything like certain or touch their face, but their disinfecting with warm soapy water or hand sanitizer."
3179,Xmbl7GcGxwI.mp4,The handshake is a tough thing is it's really ingrained in our culture.
3180,Xmbl7GcGxwI.mp4,Right?
3181,Xmbl7GcGxwI.mp4,"I mean, you know, even now, you know, I'm meeting people part of me is like resisting the urge to extend my hand out to shake people's hands."
3182,Xmbl7GcGxwI.mp4,"So I Having something with a gesture the elbow is certainly I think the safer thing than the fist bump just having that momentary contact with an area that's not going to go anywhere near your face, you know even just kind of a slight nod or a bow oftentimes."
3183,Xmbl7GcGxwI.mp4,I get kind of the the job done.
3184,Xmbl7GcGxwI.mp4,We need to keep calm.
3185,Xmbl7GcGxwI.mp4,"We had to kind of take this with the appropriate level of seriousness protect the people that are at risk of having worse outcomes, but the rest of us need to just kind of take the anxiety down one notch realize that we're going to get through this it's going to be here."
3186,Xmbl7GcGxwI.mp4,It's going to pass through our communities.
3187,Xmbl7GcGxwI.mp4,"He's and so we really just need to kind of do things that are smart, but try to avoid panic."
3188,o74nLLD7YCY.mp4,Coronavirus obviously has created a global state of uncertainty.
3189,o74nLLD7YCY.mp4,I think we're going to be having a mental health crisis now covid-19 can be characterized as a pandemic normality as it was before will not come back full on until we get a vaccine for this.
3190,o74nLLD7YCY.mp4,It's important to recognize both the immediate and the long-term impacts that this pandemic can have on people's mental.Health there are different phases of mental health distress that when experiences at different points in a pandemic.
3191,o74nLLD7YCY.mp4,The other difference is that probably distinguish it from other disasters would be the level of self-isolation physical distancing travel restrictions.

3193,o74nLLD7YCY.mp4,We saw kind of initial rates of General psychological distress that exceeded amount that we would normally expect emergence of depression anxiety early on and then individuals that were involved.
3194,o74nLLD7YCY.mp4,We also see Persistence of some of those symptoms.
3195,o74nLLD7YCY.mp4,For science get out of here.
3196,o74nLLD7YCY.mp4,"If we go to other disasters like 9/11, for example, it's a kind of disaster."
3197,o74nLLD7YCY.mp4,That was abrupt.
3198,o74nLLD7YCY.mp4,I think it's different in the sense of what we're seeing right now those who are closest to it.
3199,o74nLLD7YCY.mp4,We had losses who were involved as First Responders were more likely to suffer post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms depression anxiety and distress and we do have studies that are decades later that still show that there are some residual effects for some individuals And I suspect that for many people.

3205,o74nLLD7YCY.mp4,Number one as in this is the biggest one of all stay in contact with other people.
3206,o74nLLD7YCY.mp4,The biggest thing that we are missing is contact with with the people that we care about our co-workers a good old-fashioned phone call being in touch with social media is number one.
3207,o74nLLD7YCY.mp4,"Number two, we want to manage the amount of information coming and we need to be informed the World Health Organization is now calling the global coronavirus outbreak a pandemic news."
3208,o74nLLD7YCY.mp4,Is tough the predictions blunt a we don't need to be inundated with a lot of information.
3209,o74nLLD7YCY.mp4,So limit your access to the Newt set a time where you can actually touch base and find out what you need to and then carry on with your regular day number three have a regular routine as close as possible.
3210,o74nLLD7YCY.mp4,It won't be what you're used to but said we're taking as much as you can and so my next point is ultimately about learning to be okay with things not being perfect.

3215,o74nLLD7YCY.mp4,What matters most is that we get through this with a sound state of mine and a healthy state of well-being.
3216,o74nLLD7YCY.mp4,We need to change our thoughts from the what if to the now what that gives us some sense of control.
3217,o74nLLD7YCY.mp4,But more were able to write them down that will give us greater control over things instead of just looping them through in our heads.
3218,o74nLLD7YCY.mp4,And if our anxiety gets to a physical level of panic and that might be the case for many people watch how we breathe what we might not be realizing.

3306,MnxO48joRZQ.mp4,I think it's really this trust between the community and the helical system.
3307,MnxO48joRZQ.mp4,It's doctors.
3308,MnxO48joRZQ.mp4,It's nurses its Allied health professionals and it's Village volunteers that makes this whole system runs.
3309,MnxO48joRZQ.mp4,So effectively I think one of the very good reason that we can manage covid-19 very well was that if you look at Ty cultures whenever we have crisis the time you g night.
3310,MNS68IyfKvs.mp4,In the fight against covid-19 researchers need to know where it is and how it's spreading.
3311,MNS68IyfKvs.mp4,"What we're trying to do is to improve the understanding of how the covid-19 pandemic is progressing across England around the world researchers are starting Community transmission studies to try and gather enough data to inform Public Health policies, but to get enough data, they need to find a way of testing people at home."
3312,MNS68IyfKvs.mp4,Don't eat or swallow any part of the kit people.
3313,MNS68IyfKvs.mp4,Me got it.
3314,MNS68IyfKvs.mp4,I'm Anna and today I'm going to be doing an antibody test for covid-19.
3315,MNS68IyfKvs.mp4,I'm one of the first guinea pigs for a home antibody tests being trialed here in the UK.
3316,MNS68IyfKvs.mp4,So I'm involved in a study called react and react stands for Real Time assessment of community transmission Christina Aitchison at Imperial College.
3317,MNS68IyfKvs.mp4,London is part of the team behind the study.
3318,MNS68IyfKvs.mp4,Before rolling out a full-scale community transmission study.
3319,MNS68IyfKvs.mp4,They need to First figure out where the kits like these are accurate and usable to test for accuracy.
3320,MNS68IyfKvs.mp4,The team are comparing self-administered results with proper blood tests in the lab to test for usability.
3321,MNS68IyfKvs.mp4,"They've posted home test kits to 10,000 randomly selected people including me."
3322,MNS68IyfKvs.mp4,So what we're really trying to understand here in the usability study is firstly whether people can perform the test at home.
3323,MNS68IyfKvs.mp4,And it's not what changes we can make to the test or instructions to improve people's ability to carry out the test at home.
3324,MNS68IyfKvs.mp4,"Oh, no, it's just going back up."
3325,MNS68IyfKvs.mp4,There are of sprayed blood everywhere.
3326,MNS68IyfKvs.mp4,"No, no, okay got it in and secondly can people read and interpret the test results."
3327,MNS68IyfKvs.mp4,And if not what changes can we make to the wording and messaging to improve people's ability to understand what the result means for them antibody tests like this.
3328,MNS68IyfKvs.mp4,"They aren't designed to tell me if I currently have covid-19, but could tell me if I've been infected before in this case by testing for a type of antibody called IGG."
3329,MNS68IyfKvs.mp4,"It's a really what we're most interested in is IGG as a marker as a potential market for long term of unity, certainly another infections."
3330,MNS68IyfKvs.mp4,It is a mark of long-term immunity.
3331,MNS68IyfKvs.mp4,But as yet we don't know if it is for covid-19 immunologist still working to find out whether having had the novel coronavirus and having IGG antibodies in your blood will in fact protect you from Catching it again in the future until then my results aren't very much used to me.
3332,MNS68IyfKvs.mp4,Personally.
3333,MNS68IyfKvs.mp4,I'll still be observing social.
3334,MNS68IyfKvs.mp4,Dancing like everyone else but for Christina and her team my data can help get the home antibody testing kits in top shape for the next round of tests.
3335,MNS68IyfKvs.mp4,Once we've optimized usability for home testing.
3336,MNS68IyfKvs.mp4,Then we plan to roll out the test to a hundred thousand randomly selected people across England to assess the prevalence of past infection in the community.
3337,MNS68IyfKvs.mp4,In the meantime.
3338,MNS68IyfKvs.mp4,There's a lot of work to do.
3339,MNS68IyfKvs.mp4,I've worked a lot on weekends over the last two or three months.
3340,MNS68IyfKvs.mp4,It's things are changing all the time every other day in the news.
3341,MNS68IyfKvs.mp4,You hear about it.
3342,MNS68IyfKvs.mp4,Another test be it be it as a new swab test or a game-changing antibody test.
3343,MNS68IyfKvs.mp4,People are very desperate to and Keen to know when we're going to get back to some level of a normality.
3344,MNS68IyfKvs.mp4,"So with that in mind whistle whistle of happy to be working twice as hard,"
3345,zr5uN32mkhU.mp4,When people say to me a lot of things are broken in the response to covid in the US the response has not been good.
3346,zr5uN32mkhU.mp4,The one thing that hasn't been broken is the research infrastructure face one is is the one where you it's about safety and immunogenicity.
3347,zr5uN32mkhU.mp4,"So you take a very small group of people healthy individuals that you give the vaccine to a determine if it's safe and be determined in that case of a vaccine if it produces antibodies, you try to define the maximum possible dose that is safe to produce a maximum antibody response and for that you go into different populations you Take younger older, especially older individuals because they don't respond as well."
3348,zr5uN32mkhU.mp4,This is sort of the where the rubber meets the road.
3349,zr5uN32mkhU.mp4,This is where you take people you give the vaccine you compared to Placebo large populations to see if it actually protects.
3350,zr5uN32mkhU.mp4,They're not skipping any stage.
3351,zr5uN32mkhU.mp4,It's just being done a very quick face is just being done faster than it would normally be the time from virus identification to the first injection humans was 65 days.
3352,zr5uN32mkhU.mp4,I mean that is the speed of light that is so fast that it's just unbelievable.
3353,zr5uN32mkhU.mp4,"Hey, thanks for watching."

3355,GfqGJXLfq-c.mp4,This conference has shown that Infidel mix is a topic that spans so many disciplines and I really believe it's shown me that the answer lies at the Confluence of all of these different perspectives.
3356,GfqGJXLfq-c.mp4,It's really shown the need to think about how we perceive and process information how we understand and Elevate expertise.
3357,GfqGJXLfq-c.mp4,And also how we intervene in complex environments.
3358,GfqGJXLfq-c.mp4,"And I think that's the about not only what information is communicated to different audiences, but how it is translated and then received and the real importance of understanding different communities perceptions of what is valuable."
3359,GfqGJXLfq-c.mp4,I think in terms of thinking about what we need to explore in scrutinize further in this realm is really understanding that relationship between trust and expertise trying to get a sense of which kind of expert is.
3360,GfqGJXLfq-c.mp4,You need to be preferable in different communities and are there Universal standards that we can try and Elevate?
3361,GfqGJXLfq-c.mp4,I think that's critical for thinking further about the kind of intervention.
3362,GfqGJXLfq-c.mp4,We might want to make in order to help identify trustworthy sources of expertise.
3363,0pVEO0bkreA.mp4,During this time where so many of us are being encouraged to stay at home.
3364,0pVEO0bkreA.mp4,"We understand that people are getting cabin fever and may feel like they need to spend some time outside and certainly spending time outdoors and getting physical activity is something that we still currently support but be thoughtful about the time that you are spending out there avoid those high traffic areas don't go to the places where you know, they're going to be lots of people in order to continue to spend this time outside and enjoy this lovely Spring weather."
3365,0pVEO0bkreA.mp4,We still have to maintain that social distancing so that 2 meter or 6 feet rule is going to be what you want to achieve when you're out and about going for a run or having a hike in the in the forest.
3366,Up1UY6L-Bmo.mp4,"Let's get more on that wavering guidance from the CDC by talking to our David agus who joins us now, dr. Agus good morning to you."
3367,Up1UY6L-Bmo.mp4,So the CDC was already saying that the virus spreads easily and rapidly between people but it was focused on the droplets that hang in the air as opposed to these aerosols.
3368,Up1UY6L-Bmo.mp4,Which float I guess four hours.
3369,Up1UY6L-Bmo.mp4,How big is that distinction?
3370,Up1UY6L-Bmo.mp4,"Well, you know the droplets are within six feet when you and I speak droplets come out and we know that is the dominant mode of transmission of the virus period that being said aerosols the virus can float in the air linger longer and further that maybe a mode of transmission."
3371,Up1UY6L-Bmo.mp4,"It's not the dominant mode, but it may be a motive transition."
3372,Up1UY6L-Bmo.mp4,"We just don't know what you're seeing is the sausage being made for the first time in front of the American public, right?"
3373,Up1UY6L-Bmo.mp4,"We are learning the science as we go in this New we normally know the science because viruses have been around for a long time as other diseases, but here we're learning as we go."
3374,Up1UY6L-Bmo.mp4,Do you think the CDC given the challenges?
3375,Up1UY6L-Bmo.mp4,"It's had recently with maintaining public trust should have just kept the guidance up we heard dr. Ulster home from the University of Minnesota say actually, this is good science."
3376,Up1UY6L-Bmo.mp4,It was fine.
3377,Up1UY6L-Bmo.mp4,Why not publish it?
3378,Up1UY6L-Bmo.mp4,"You know, what's interesting."
3379,Up1UY6L-Bmo.mp4,Is that science going up on a website and then literally a day or two later somebody finding that and putting that into the media I do think is the wrong way to go.
3380,Up1UY6L-Bmo.mp4,I think that there needs to be a conversation whenever there's a change explain it in detail because there are a lot of policy implications for changing that guidance.
3381,Up1UY6L-Bmo.mp4,And so I think that we deserve a conversation we deserve an explanation of what are the data and why not just to change on a website.
3382,Up1UY6L-Bmo.mp4,So how would our lives change if this guidance became New rule at the CDC that this was a virus spreading through aerosolized particles.
3383,Up1UY6L-Bmo.mp4,"Well, it would change how we isolate patients in a hospital for example, and they would need specialized rooms and that have specialized ventilation which we don't have that many of them in the country."
3384,Up1UY6L-Bmo.mp4,It would change some of the requirements for opening schools restaurants indoor places to require certain ventilation requirements that are now not always there in many of these establishments.
3385,Up1UY6L-Bmo.mp4,So this is a big policy change if it goes through I think discussion needs to happen.
3386,Up1UY6L-Bmo.mp4,"All right, so but for the moment we're King droplets and we're thinking six feet no more and we await further word from the CDC and dr. De Vegas."
3387,Up1UY6L-Bmo.mp4,Thank you very much.
3388,Up1UY6L-Bmo.mp4,"Well, and and we're thinking masks masks."
3389,Up1UY6L-Bmo.mp4,Of course mast cells they block everything goes without saying.
3390,Up1UY6L-Bmo.mp4,All right.
3391,Up1UY6L-Bmo.mp4,Thank you very much.

3394,XvfvI1sbzKo.mp4,I'm Adam Brady.
3395,XvfvI1sbzKo.mp4,I'm board certified in infectious disease and internal medicine and I see patients at Samaritan infectious disease in Corvallis.
3396,XvfvI1sbzKo.mp4,It is very important for all of us to follow these basic steps to avoid spreading infection steps that you can take to prevent spreading the flu and the common cold will also help prevent the spread of Coronavirus.
3397,XvfvI1sbzKo.mp4,Wash your hands often with soap and water for 20 seconds.
3398,XvfvI1sbzKo.mp4,If soap is not available use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer avoid touching your eyes nose or mouth avoid close contact with people who are sick.
3399,XvfvI1sbzKo.mp4,Stay home while you were sick and avoid contact with others cover your cough or sneeze with the tissue then throw it away.
3400,XvfvI1sbzKo.mp4,If you don't have a tissue cough into your elbow clean and disinfect objects and surfaces that you frequently touch around the house the Oregon Health Authority and Centers for Disease Control and prevention websites offer.
3401,XvfvI1sbzKo.mp4,Very helpful self care tips the Centers for Disease Control and prevention recently recommended the use of cloth.
3402,XvfvI1sbzKo.mp4,Face coverings in public areas where it is difficult to remain social distancing such as grocery stores and pharmacies medical grade Surgical and in 95 Mass must continue to be reserved for healthcare workers.
3403,XvfvI1sbzKo.mp4,Thanks to each of you for doing your part to prevent the spread of coronavirus and help us to build healthier communities together.
3404,vxIzke8IISQ.mp4,"Hello friends today, we'll learn about Novell coronavirus."
3405,vxIzke8IISQ.mp4,Mmm coronavirus has are a type of virus.
3406,vxIzke8IISQ.mp4,There's so many different kinds and some caused several diseases the 2019.
3407,vxIzke8IISQ.mp4,No Veil or new coronavirus has been named SARS Covey to and the disease it causes is called coronavirus disease 2019 or covid-19 it.
3408,vxIzke8IISQ.mp4,It appeared in Wuhan a city in China in December 2019.
3409,vxIzke8IISQ.mp4,Although Health officials are still tracing the exact source of this new coronavirus investigations are ongoing as to how this harmful virus originated and spread with more than 109 countries confirming coronavirus cases and many other countries reporting suspected cases.
3410,vxIzke8IISQ.mp4,The outbreak has already placed the world on a health emergency.
3411,vxIzke8IISQ.mp4,"China is the most affected so far and it is quickly spreading to Italy Iran South Korea France Spain Germany USA, Switzerland, Japan and India diagnosis of covid-19 may be difficult with only a physical exam because mild cases of this may appear similar to a bad cold or flu it can be spread from person to person being within six feet of someone who is sick."
3412,vxIzke8IISQ.mp4,Can get you or your personal space contaminated a Laboratory test can confirm the diagnosis the following symptoms may appear to to 14 days after exposure fever.
3413,vxIzke8IISQ.mp4,"cough shortness of breath people with weakened immune systems May develop more serious symptoms like bronchitis or pneumonia, you may never develop symptoms after being exposed to covid-19."
3414,vxIzke8IISQ.mp4,"So far most confirmed cases are in adults, but some children have also been infected."
3415,vxIzke8IISQ.mp4,There's no evidence that kids are at a greater risk for getting the virus the Centers for Disease Control and prevention have a few suggestions.
3416,vxIzke8IISQ.mp4,Let's see them.
3417,vxIzke8IISQ.mp4,Wash your hands frequently and thoroughly for at least 20 seconds use a good alcohol-based hand sanitizer if water and soap aren't available avoid touching your eyes mouth or nose with unwashed hands cover coffin sneezes with a clean tissue and then throw the tissue in the trash carefully disinfect and clean surfaces and objects people frequently touch stay at home when you're sick if you have covid-19.
3418,vxIzke8IISQ.mp4,A face mask to prevent spreading the deadly virus to others.
3419,vxIzke8IISQ.mp4,The CDC does not actually recommend wearing a mask.
3420,vxIzke8IISQ.mp4,If you're not infected.
3421,vxIzke8IISQ.mp4,There are no specific treatments for this till now but symptoms can be treated.
3422,vxIzke8IISQ.mp4,So be careful and please do not panic call help line numbers when required and please consult a doctor always help others.
3423,vxIzke8IISQ.mp4,Stay safe.
3424,Ha8Yu2fBe08.mp4,Ray biotechs covid-19 rapid tests enable the qualitative detection of IGM and IGG antibodies to the czar's Covey to viral n protein in human serum whole blood and fingerprint samples in less than 10 minutes.
3425,Ha8Yu2fBe08.mp4,Each rapid test kit will arrive in a box containing the materials to perform 20 individual tests.
3426,Ha8Yu2fBe08.mp4,This includes one instruction manual 20 detection cassettes 20-plus.Pipettes and 20 vials the sample diluent both the detection cassettes and pipettes may be inside the foil packet the Lancet set for finger prick samples can be purchased separately and includes 20 lancets 20 alcohol swabs and 20 adhesive bandages to perform a test first open a foil packet containing the detection cassette.
3427,Ha8Yu2fBe08.mp4,Set aside one detection cassette one plastic pipette and one vial a sample diluent for finger Pricks.
3428,Ha8Yu2fBe08.mp4,You will also need one Lancet one alcohol swab and one adhesive bandage next to dislodge any sample diluent that maybe in the cap tap the vial on a hard surface and set it to the side.
3429,Ha8Yu2fBe08.mp4,Four finger prick samples massaging your finger may help improve blood flow to the fingertip disinfect the finger with alcohol swab and let it air dry for 10 seconds then use the Lancet to draw blood from the finger.
3430,Ha8Yu2fBe08.mp4,And disinfect the finger with alcohol swab again.
3431,Ha8Yu2fBe08.mp4,Once a good drop of blood has formed on the finger use the plastic pipette to fill the narrow part of the pipette with blood try to avoid forming bubbles to ensure that the amount of blood collected is correct serum can also be used during this step.
3432,Ha8Yu2fBe08.mp4,"immediately place the blood into the vial of sample diluent squeeze the pipette bulb three to five times to mix well, Add two to three drops of the diluted blood to the detection cassette finally apply an adhesive bandage to the finger."
3433,Ha8Yu2fBe08.mp4,This is a Time course video taken of to test run side-by-side using finger prick samples on the left is a sample from a covid-19 negative patient on the right is a sample from a covid-19 positive patient the control line at the top of the cassette should appear.
3434,Ha8Yu2fBe08.mp4,This line is for quality control and ensures that the assay is working properly red blood cells will migrate across the device slowly read the results before the red blood cell.
3435,Ha8Yu2fBe08.mp4,It reaches the test line results read after 20 minutes are not accurate a band at the test line indicates that antibodies have been produced in response to covid-19 infection the band intensity May range from faint pink to dark pink.

3438,M51HeDfyWV4.mp4,But is it safe to go back to school?
3439,M51HeDfyWV4.mp4,"Yeah, I think we need to change school to ensure that you know, they are good Provisions in place to ensure social distancing to ensure that the infection risk is minimized that many good examples of school.In this for the summer break who have been able to reconcile effective learning and ensuring the safety and health of students teachers and communities."
3440,M51HeDfyWV4.mp4,That means sometimes closing public spaces in school staggering mealtimes limiting the kind of configurations in learning environments.
3441,M51HeDfyWV4.mp4,"When you think of traditional classrooms, you have a teacher in front of students, you know talking about the subject and assuming everybody learns at the same place the same Pace when it comes to knowledge Transmission technology has become very good."
3442,M51HeDfyWV4.mp4,If you have a teacher just delivering a lecture on Zoom.
3443,M51HeDfyWV4.mp4,That's not very effective.
3444,M51HeDfyWV4.mp4,That's basically all teaching using new technology.
3445,M51HeDfyWV4.mp4,I think you need to change your Podiatry.
3446,M51HeDfyWV4.mp4,"You need to capitalize on the opportunities of Technology not making learning more and more interesting more engaging more granular more personal and then bringing the personal aspect to support the coaching and mentoring on a one-by-one basis and I think if you use that Malaysian you're going to be a very effective teacher you use technology at its best, you know, you know you was teaching at its best."

3465,PtpQQdtggIU.mp4,The coronavirus pandemic was topic number one at last night's presidential debate as infections are now on the rise in nearly every state especially in the midwest right now.
3466,PtpQQdtggIU.mp4,And yesterday the FDA approved Gilly has antiviral R MD severe to treat covid-19 patients shares of Gilead by the way up about 4% here in the pre-market joining us now is dr. Derek Cass Yahoo!
3467,PtpQQdtggIU.mp4,Medical contributor and Columbia University associate professor of emergency medicine doctor.Asking Friday morning to you.
3468,PtpQQdtggIU.mp4,So talk to us about groomed a severe because we know that it was already being used to some extent as a treatment for covid-19.
3469,PtpQQdtggIU.mp4,How important is this actual FDA approval in the fight against the infection is actually not that important for patient care and so far as all it's saying is that the continued use of the EU a the emergency use authorization and the studies that came out prove that this medication was effective in patients who are hospitalized and sick from this coronavirus over the age of 12 is what it was approved for.
3470,PtpQQdtggIU.mp4,So now there's just more availability of this medication and there's less restriction going forward.
3471,PtpQQdtggIU.mp4,It is now officially approved by the FDA for use for this disease remembering that it does not change mortality.
3472,PtpQQdtggIU.mp4,It's not saving lives.
3473,PtpQQdtggIU.mp4,It's just decreasing hospitalizations and decreasing symptoms.
3474,PtpQQdtggIU.mp4,Dr. Katz yesterday we had on Southwest CEO Gary Kelly.
3475,PtpQQdtggIU.mp4,They're now going to start packing out their planes if people are even going to fly is that safe that they're now selling all their seats again?
3476,PtpQQdtggIU.mp4,So I was really impressed with that announcement was actually how they announced how they came to that decision.
3477,PtpQQdtggIU.mp4,In fact Southwest Airlines put out a full Twitter thread explaining how they came to that decision based on the data available from transmissions on planes.
3478,PtpQQdtggIU.mp4,And I think that that's exactly what we need to see if a company is going to make a decision it seems Counterintuitive as long as they explain the science behind their decision and not just that it was a let's see what happens decision.
3479,PtpQQdtggIU.mp4,"I think that's okay and I think it can be considered as safe as keeping that middle seat open, so I actually think they did a good job with that."
3480,PtpQQdtggIU.mp4,During the debate last night.
3481,PtpQQdtggIU.mp4,A lot of it was about the coronavirus and how the Trump Administration has been handling how Joe Biden Administration would be handling it and and President Trump again talked about having a vaccine sooner rather than later saying we could have something we will have something by the end of the year and he called out a few companies Johnson & Johnson moderna and Pfizer from what you're seeing and you're hearing in the medical community.
3482,PtpQQdtggIU.mp4,How accurate is that?
3483,PtpQQdtggIU.mp4,So remembering that he actually calls it a vaccine that seems To be almost ready for Primetime that's on pause right now from the safety data.
3484,PtpQQdtggIU.mp4,"So I think that his declarations about the proximity of a vaccine are certainly as hopeful and is he's been for every other thing not really grounded in the science and the data, we do know that both the Pfizer vaccine and the moderna vaccine are continuing their phase 3 clinical trials and that we expect the Pfizer vaccine to come out with some data at the end of November and moderna in December both of them agreeing to this two-month period after the completion of their Phase 3 clinical trials waiting for other, you know efficacy and safety data to come through completely and the FDA is in support of that."
3485,PtpQQdtggIU.mp4,"So no, we're not very close to a vaccine just yet and more importantly, even if we see the candidate or multiple candidates that look effective and safe getting them into the arms of Americans and having people trust this vaccine is a good idea for them to take is still another hurdle that we have and haven't we haven't even begun to address?"
3486,PtpQQdtggIU.mp4,Yeah doc has what does that process look like because the president appears to be under the assumption they hand the vaccine off to the military and poof.
3487,PtpQQdtggIU.mp4,It's at our house.
3488,PtpQQdtggIU.mp4,Right?
3489,PtpQQdtggIU.mp4,So a lot of the assumptions the president makes about both the willingness of people to take the vaccine and the execution of how this vaccine is distributed remembering that the moderna vaccine for example is an mRNA vaccine that is contained at Sub-Zero temperatures.
3490,PtpQQdtggIU.mp4,So we need to make sure that the vaccine candidate that comes forward will be able to be implemented and distributed widely and there's a lot of stuff.
3491,PtpQQdtggIU.mp4,In the middle of approving a vaccine and deciding it safe and effective to getting into American Arms.
3492,PtpQQdtggIU.mp4,And unfortunately that data usually is escape the president when he declares that we're almost there for distribution and we keep tossed talking about testing testing has become more robust in this country.
3493,PtpQQdtggIU.mp4,But how important is it?
3494,PtpQQdtggIU.mp4,"How can we use it perhaps in ways, we're not using it now or more effectively."
3495,PtpQQdtggIU.mp4,Maybe I should say and helping to get the economy and schools back up and running to as close to 100% we can get because I've been reading that we may be wearing masks until at least 2020 to and I think there's just a lot of fatigue already in this country about wearing masks.
3496,PtpQQdtggIU.mp4,We hear something like that.
3497,PtpQQdtggIU.mp4,I think it really it really makes people feel like they're behind the eight ball.
3498,PtpQQdtggIU.mp4,Right?
3499,PtpQQdtggIU.mp4,"So I think the use of data were under utilizing the data we have and we're not really being transparent about what's working, which I think is unfortunate."
3500,PtpQQdtggIU.mp4,Right and schools are a great example.
3501,PtpQQdtggIU.mp4,"So if we could do pull testing which means that every kid in this school is tested, sometimes it's saliva."
3502,PtpQQdtggIU.mp4,"It's all into one big testing pool and then you find the positive cases and you do it regularly we could see how well the masks and the small classrooms are doing and we could even increase in theory the size of the classes if we know that we can find those cases early take those kids out of the classroom isolate them and prove very specifically that we're not seeing transmission among students to student or even student to teacher but that requires a lot of investment in testing and infrastructure in ventilation and in data, and unfortunately, we're just not seeing this Administration invest in that set of work and that's why we're really behind the eight ball when it comes to well just keep wearing masks."
3503,PtpQQdtggIU.mp4,That's basically all they're telling us to do.
3504,PtpQQdtggIU.mp4,All right.
3505,PtpQQdtggIU.mp4,Dr. Derek has thanks for putting it in perspective for us.
3506,PtpQQdtggIU.mp4,See you next week the next week.
3507,1PrlxKPk6rk.mp4,"It's only been a few weeks of distancing for Canadians, but doesn't it already looks strange to see people out together."
3508,1PrlxKPk6rk.mp4,So close together.
3509,1PrlxKPk6rk.mp4,Strange to to know these aren't old pictures.
3510,1PrlxKPk6rk.mp4,This is Singapore days ago a densely populated city state of 6 million making hugely to confronting covid-19.
3511,1PrlxKPk6rk.mp4,Only a thousand cases less than half a dozen deaths.
3512,1PrlxKPk6rk.mp4,Look at its enviously flat curve and now look at Canada's the contact tracers of Singapore are crucial their detective work identified more than 50 percent of all cases.
3513,1PrlxKPk6rk.mp4,Most people who had no idea.
3514,1PrlxKPk6rk.mp4,They were infected one Trace can take hours with each person who test positive so we go down breakfast lunch dinner supper and teased if it's in between and then we traced out who are the people that for each of those contacts.
3515,1PrlxKPk6rk.mp4,They could have come in contact with then in partnership with police contacts are visited.
3516,1PrlxKPk6rk.mp4,They sign agreements to stay quarantined and know it's jail if they don't it's so effective.
3517,1PrlxKPk6rk.mp4,Some Commerce has been able to stay open.
3518,1PrlxKPk6rk.mp4,So how's Canada fairing on contact tracing?
3519,1PrlxKPk6rk.mp4,So the majority of jurisdictions actually have for now but a few have said look if this the cases go up in the next couple of weeks.
3520,1PrlxKPk6rk.mp4,We're going to need some help.
3521,1PrlxKPk6rk.mp4,They will need help and will likely turn to a place like this a Trace.
3522,1PrlxKPk6rk.mp4,Sing center in Alberta The Province leads the way in mobilizing tracers Public Health nurses in conjunction with newly trained medical students over 300 of them taught how to do this by Richelle Schindler on that whole team together is doing every single case in Alberta right now.
3523,1PrlxKPk6rk.mp4,So I believe that's about 60 a day and we're definitely not maxed out we can do more.
3524,1PrlxKPk6rk.mp4,It's picking apart credit card statements bus schedules helping someone already stressed.
3525,1PrlxKPk6rk.mp4,Remember vital details initially some thought contact tracing would only be effective in the early days that the virus would eventually outpaced efforts to chase.
3526,1PrlxKPk6rk.mp4,It success stories prove that wrong one thing we've learned from China South Korea.
3527,1PrlxKPk6rk.mp4,Japan is that you never stop doing this work through aggressive contact tracing and isolation of contacts.
3528,1PrlxKPk6rk.mp4,They were able to get it under control.
3529,1PrlxKPk6rk.mp4,If you think you can help do this.
3530,1PrlxKPk6rk.mp4,She advises consider contacting like Health agencies it may soon need more Canadians to step up.
3531,8jyE-IZCm3Y.mp4,covid-19 is the disease which is caused by the new virus which is circulating through our community it primarily affects the lungs and the Heart through direct infection the immune system response to that infection with a sometimes robust response that can lead to symptoms of severe shortness of breath and even require respiratory support with a ventilator most patients can recover but patients who are either immunocompromised or Elderly are at higher risk.
3532,8jyE-IZCm3Y.mp4,"Most people don't have cardiac involvement at that point but later in the disease, if it becomes more severe than the heart function can decrease the heart function decreases sometimes because of the systemic inflammatory response to the virus and in some people because of direct viral infection in the heart caused Maya causing myocarditis."
3533,8jyE-IZCm3Y.mp4,There are two dominant cardiac issues the biggest they 8090 percent is older.
3534,8jyE-IZCm3Y.mp4,All who are now on a ventilator who have respiratory failure and now they've developed heart failure that is occurring in the context of people with hypertension people with coronary artery disease who have decreased Reserve capacity and it may be that the medicines that we use to support blood pressure are actually leading to some of the deterioration and heart function in that context.
3535,8jyE-IZCm3Y.mp4,"That's a different group people with structural heart disease than the young person who comes in with an acute chest pain syndrome short of breath and that may be the myocarditis presentation at the end of both of those Pathways could be myocarditis, but early on it looks like in the older group."
3536,8jyE-IZCm3Y.mp4,"It's probably the effect of underlying structural heart disease response to cytokines and in the younger group, it's it may well be a primary myocarditis."
3537,8jyE-IZCm3Y.mp4,So today for many people who present with heart failure in the context of covid-19 infection.
3538,8jyE-IZCm3Y.mp4,We don't know if Heart failure is related to myocarditis or to a response to systemic inflammation.
3539,8jyE-IZCm3Y.mp4,"There's no evidence that any of the commonly used medications for any cardiovascular disorders in the United States will put you at heightened risk of the infection or the consequences of infection specifically ACE inhibitors and Angiotensin receptor blockers, which work on the Ace One receptor are not going to impact the course or risk of covid-19 infection in patients who are at home who have been diagnosed with covid-19 infection, but who do not feel short of breath or have low blood pressure."
3540,8jyE-IZCm3Y.mp4,They should continue taking their blood pressure medicines in patients who have more symptoms.
3541,8jyE-IZCm3Y.mp4,They should consult with their physician.
3542,8jyE-IZCm3Y.mp4,There are a number of really exciting research directions that we are currently engaged in at this point.
3543,8jyE-IZCm3Y.mp4,It's gratifying to see institutions like the American Heart Association and the National Institutes of Health stepping up to promote Research into covid-19 cardiovascular impact both at the population level.
3544,8jyE-IZCm3Y.mp4,And at the the individual person level is going to be a huge impact in the next one to two years from this investment.
3545,8jyE-IZCm3Y.mp4,First we acknowledge.
3546,8jyE-IZCm3Y.mp4,This is a stressful time.
3547,8jyE-IZCm3Y.mp4,"It's a stressful time for everyone including healthcare workers and and people who are in the community because of the economic and social impact of this disease, even if you don't have it yourself and that can put people at heightened risk for all sorts of stress-related illnesses."
3548,8jyE-IZCm3Y.mp4,"I think that mindfulness taking care of yourself trying to maintain an exercise regimen if you had been before our key to maintaining health and even though we were instructed now to avoid gathering in large groups maintaining social contact through the internet through telephone is really important that we don't lose contact and become depressed or otherwise isolated because of this new illness now as before if people develop chest pain or shortness of breath, they should seek medical attention first by Seeing their healthcare provider or if it's severe 911 shortness of breath is very common."
3549,8jyE-IZCm3Y.mp4,"And only a minority of people today will actually have covid-19 infection Who develops shortness of breath all of the common reasons, for example, structural lung and heart disease are still there and need to be considered."
3550,8jyE-IZCm3Y.mp4,"That's why it's important to contact your local physician or your usual care provider if you develop these symptoms,"
3551,f79ZWa8ZTwo.mp4,I'll be at this emergency department in North West Toronto.
3552,f79ZWa8ZTwo.mp4,They're not taking any chances along with blood pressure and other Vital Information questions about foreign travel.
3553,f79ZWa8ZTwo.mp4,All of the logistics are mapped out here and were able to act on each one of them in the Humber River Hospital is Command Center staff monitor the entire facility's Vital Signs this new hospital was built with outbreaks in mind.
3554,f79ZWa8ZTwo.mp4,I can't you know stress.How incredibly unprepared we were for SARS.
3555,f79ZWa8ZTwo.mp4,This is where in a such a better position.
3556,f79ZWa8ZTwo.mp4,"Now, the hospital's chief of staff was in the thick of the tsar's crisis 17 years ago, when week protocols spurred on the spread of the virus."
3557,f79ZWa8ZTwo.mp4,It was about running around and trying to buy respirators.
3558,f79ZWa8ZTwo.mp4,"It was around, you know, trying to set up negative pressure rooms and hiring additional screeners and things like that."
3559,f79ZWa8ZTwo.mp4,Those things are kind of baked into our system now airports are stepping up screening of international Travelers.
3560,f79ZWa8ZTwo.mp4,But they may not show any symptoms during their flights.
3561,f79ZWa8ZTwo.mp4,"So hospitals remain at the front lines if the outbreak spreads, it's really important that we isolate those patients right away at another Toronto Hospital."
3562,f79ZWa8ZTwo.mp4,There's a palpable sense of Readiness.
3563,f79ZWa8ZTwo.mp4,The emergency department has already dealt with cases that tested negative for the coronavirus.
3564,f79ZWa8ZTwo.mp4,We've had three patients that have come in with a travel history who presented with these symptoms.
3565,f79ZWa8ZTwo.mp4,They've done a phenomenal job and getting those patients into the appropriate isolation right away the department Juror is another veteran of the tsar's crisis.
3566,f79ZWa8ZTwo.mp4,I think people have to appreciate that.
3567,f79ZWa8ZTwo.mp4,It's not the same as SARS.
3568,f79ZWa8ZTwo.mp4,It's not presenting the same.
3569,f79ZWa8ZTwo.mp4,It hasn't the numbers aren't the same the death rate the mortality rates not the same.
3570,f79ZWa8ZTwo.mp4,"So as long as we keep an eye on it, I think we should be well prepared prepared and ready for if tomorrow the who declares a new Global Health Emergency Vic adobea CBC News, Toronto."
3571,0DWCpNffhyw.mp4,"Hi, my name is super Dot and welcome to covid for kids."
3572,0DWCpNffhyw.mp4,Why do all the grown-ups tell us to stay home?
3573,0DWCpNffhyw.mp4,And why can't we play with our friends?
3574,0DWCpNffhyw.mp4,I've heard that it's because something sneaky called the coronavirus and you heard the same thing.
3575,0DWCpNffhyw.mp4,I thought so let's investigate.
3576,0DWCpNffhyw.mp4,A few months ago something started to make people sick scientists investigate.
3577,0DWCpNffhyw.mp4,It looks with the microscopes and found coronavirus coronavirus is a tiny virus that looks like it's wearing a crown viruses are tiny invisible things that can make people sick.
3578,0DWCpNffhyw.mp4,Have you ever caught a cold or the flu might have had Virus and someone is sick with coronavirus.
3579,0DWCpNffhyw.mp4,"It might have had a sore throat or a cough or fever kids can get sick too, but most don't feel sick at all."
3580,0DWCpNffhyw.mp4,But some people like your grandparents can get so sick.
3581,0DWCpNffhyw.mp4,They'll have to go to the hospital to feel better coronavirus sneaks around and teeny tiny drops of water from someone's coughs or sneezes.
3582,0DWCpNffhyw.mp4,He can hide on things like tables and doorknobs.
3583,0DWCpNffhyw.mp4,Those waiting for someone to pick it up even hitched a ride around the world that's bananas.
3584,0DWCpNffhyw.mp4,Right?
3585,0DWCpNffhyw.mp4,But I have a secret we could stop coronavirus together and just need to use our superpowers and Flash superpowers staying home as much as we can.
3586,0DWCpNffhyw.mp4,Are you doing that?
3587,0DWCpNffhyw.mp4,"If you stay home, then the virus won't be able to jump onto you or your friends."
3588,0DWCpNffhyw.mp4,Second superpower is our elbow.
3589,0DWCpNffhyw.mp4,That's the place where we should trap our conferences this way.
3590,0DWCpNffhyw.mp4,We won't spray a little viruses into the air that might make someone else sick and last of all coronavirus has a super secret weakness.
3591,0DWCpNffhyw.mp4,It's super power.
3592,0DWCpNffhyw.mp4,You're right.
3593,0DWCpNffhyw.mp4,It's washing her hands.
3594,0DWCpNffhyw.mp4,"We need to wash our hands for 20 seconds after we go outside after you use the bathroom and before and after we eat, so if we stay home and wash our hands we can beat coronavirus together."
3595,0DWCpNffhyw.mp4,You could be a super dart to buy gotta fly.
3596,tfnWnHm8JxU.mp4,Across the pole because Carl is going to actually do what we would call the swabbing part of this and this is the final part of this test.
3597,tfnWnHm8JxU.mp4,So this is the actual swab that people are talking about and I'll hand you across the pond.
3598,tfnWnHm8JxU.mp4,Okay?
3599,tfnWnHm8JxU.mp4,"So Paul, hey all gone through which is we're going through this world."
3600,tfnWnHm8JxU.mp4,We have a little cutting board Yep looks like this and it replaced.
3601,tfnWnHm8JxU.mp4,We take the mask off diminished.
3602,tfnWnHm8JxU.mp4,"Okay, and we'll place this in the backyard Schult then into your nose Okay supporting last June is take off your mask."
3603,tfnWnHm8JxU.mp4,"Yes and just keep so we can put it back on you need to okay, I'm gonna ask you to blow your nose."
3604,tfnWnHm8JxU.mp4,Yeah.It says care all the areas.
3605,tfnWnHm8JxU.mp4,I said the king wants to do is just drop your head back a little bit and open your mouth wide and this is just kicking back to your old hair on both sides and acknowledge them out.
3606,tfnWnHm8JxU.mp4,Next one is be into your nose.
3607,tfnWnHm8JxU.mp4,"Once you take a deep breath in in through your nose, and this is going so just basically swap them and back out again kindness and fairness."
3608,tfnWnHm8JxU.mp4,"Yeah, I wasn't looking forward to that because in reality they're with us to put your mask back on like so which we don't need to know but for the purpose of that."
3609,tfnWnHm8JxU.mp4,"Yes, we just put the sample then it's a little bottle."
3610,tfnWnHm8JxU.mp4,Yes.
3611,tfnWnHm8JxU.mp4,I got the broken off.
3612,tfnWnHm8JxU.mp4,I should say as you're doing that that because this is just a mock-up test.
3613,tfnWnHm8JxU.mp4,"If you like, we won't be wasting resources and Times by sending this to a lab because there are more important things to be doing there at the moment."
3614,tfnWnHm8JxU.mp4,Just so people are very curious and we have here A whole pack.
3615,tfnWnHm8JxU.mp4,Thank you hon in this will give you the instructions what to do.
3616,tfnWnHm8JxU.mp4,"Just want to make sure that a living us are alone at home, right?"
3617,tfnWnHm8JxU.mp4,"Okay, and if you add that he have somebody to drop in here to make sure all is yeah real good."
3618,tfnWnHm8JxU.mp4,Yeah have sufficient food and that you have a access to a phone and you keep a mobile phone charged up.
3619,tfnWnHm8JxU.mp4,And if you need any help at all to call 911 our 999 or 112.
3620,tfnWnHm8JxU.mp4,"Yes, I look really young service soccer."
3621,tfnWnHm8JxU.mp4,And then I'll take that packet in the event top.
3622,tfnWnHm8JxU.mp4,I might choose ask you to remove that so that we're all playing by the rules.
3623,tfnWnHm8JxU.mp4,"It was Alison finished off a very important part to eliminate the Cubs because this the swab itself has to go into a protective box and it has to go to the appropriate area, but all the necessary details, so that's fully completed their by Alison and that will move on then."
3624,tfnWnHm8JxU.mp4,Okay.
3625,tfnWnHm8JxU.mp4,"So thank you having done that and thank you to all of you for giving us of your time tonight and Oh, you're busy but having done that it's quick."
3626,tfnWnHm8JxU.mp4,It's easy doesn't hurt and it could be the difference between contaminating your community and actually fixing things.
3627,tfnWnHm8JxU.mp4,So that's a that's good to know.
3628,tfnWnHm8JxU.mp4,We can't say it enough wash your hands.
3629,tfnWnHm8JxU.mp4,Yes self ice not as I released absolutely social existence.
3630,tfnWnHm8JxU.mp4,I social distance and so on.
3631,tfnWnHm8JxU.mp4,"Yes, I'm actually catches well in relation to sneezing and coughing into the sleeve."
3632,tfnWnHm8JxU.mp4,"I mean, it's already explained by your guests are is absolutely imperative that we just get that and use that All the time because it could maybe save you having to come to somewhere like this or have an office to go to someone to you or one of your loved ones as well."
3633,-n8C1mYca7k.mp4,Yesterday the government announced that pregnant women are now considered in the high-risk group for covid-19 and are being advised to limit their social interactions.
3634,-n8C1mYca7k.mp4,But why am I pregnant women be more at risk for covid-19.
3635,-n8C1mYca7k.mp4,We spoke to Erica Watson lecturer in reproductive biology at the University of Cambridge.
3636,-n8C1mYca7k.mp4,She told us that in pregnancy woman's immune systems are naturally weakened.
3637,-n8C1mYca7k.mp4,"This is so that their bodies don't reject the developing baby, but it puts them at higher risk for Bacterial and viral infection it means that they might not be able to fight off the covid-19 virus as well as someone who is not pregnant."
3638,-n8C1mYca7k.mp4,It may also increase their risk for severe symptoms such as pneumonia pneumonia affects lung function and since the developing baby relies on the mother for oxygen poorly functioning lungs and the mother will affect how much oxygen the baby gets but there is still a lot.
3639,-n8C1mYca7k.mp4,"We don't know about the effects of covid-19 on the developing baby, for example, whether it can infect the baby while Still in the womb the risk of transmission at Birth and the effects of covid-19 on the placenta."
3640,-n8C1mYca7k.mp4,The placenta is an organ which develops during pregnancy and provides the baby with oxygen and nutrients as well as protecting from infection covid-19 as a new virus and scientists are only just beginning to understand how it attacks the body given the we're not yet sure how covid-19 effects pregnancy it's recommended that pregnant women practice social distancing to protect themselves and their baby.
3641,OAjporIeOCU.mp4,"For the time being working from home is to be prioritized even for those with closed office spaces, when not possible to work from home work spaces should be arranged to ensure at least two meters between employees."
3642,OAjporIeOCU.mp4,That means one person per 16 meter squared.
3643,OAjporIeOCU.mp4,Meetings that would normally require people to meet in person should be organized online even if staff are on campus.
3644,OAjporIeOCU.mp4,Common areas are a source of contagion.
3645,OAjporIeOCU.mp4,The virus can exist temporarily on items like books and magazines.
3646,OAjporIeOCU.mp4,So they should be removed from common areas to reduce the risk of infection.
3647,OAjporIeOCU.mp4,"And of course even in common rooms, the 2 meter guideline must be followed and surfaces must be wiped down after use staff should also avoid sharing supplies and equipment."
3648,OAjporIeOCU.mp4,In situations where physical distancing is impossible physical barriers or the use of personal protective equipment like masks are recommended adjusting schedules is another way to reduce contact.
3649,OAjporIeOCU.mp4,For example break time should be staggered to minimize the number of people sharing the break room at the same time.
3650,OAjporIeOCU.mp4,If possible core work hours should be extended so that work shifts can be staggered.
3651,OAjporIeOCU.mp4,If the situation permits employees can be assigned to Small work teams and then arrange on campus rotations to reduce the number of interactions.
3652,OAjporIeOCU.mp4,By practicing physical distancing and by staggering breaks and shifts.
3653,OAjporIeOCU.mp4,We can keep our workplace safer until the situation returns to normal.
3654,OAjporIeOCU.mp4,Please visit the McGill coronavirus website for more information.

3667,xGZxFb4ak2o.mp4,"So if you notice someone who is coughing or sneezing maintain at least two meters from them who let them in Florida then I did yo, yo Le are you tingle in the Bluetooth in the top bar owner of a mortgage loan everybody?"
3668,xGZxFb4ak2o.mp4,Nobody nobody?
3669,xGZxFb4ak2o.mp4,Touch many surfaces which can be contaminated with the value of the virus and you can transfer the virus from the surface.
3670,xGZxFb4ak2o.mp4,You are safe.
3671,gI85Af-FO8I.mp4,In regards to children and being affected by covid-19.
3672,gI85Af-FO8I.mp4,"There are a lot of unknowns right now, right there are different hypotheses about why children are not as affected children's immune systems are being bombarded by lots of different viruses and things all the time."
3673,gI85Af-FO8I.mp4,"So that's one hypothesis, but children do experience symptoms much more mild than alts and they can have regular flu, like illness symptoms fever cough respiratory distress, but they can also have abdominal pain and diarrhea which are rarer symptoms but can be experienced by children and adults as well in general."
3674,gI85Af-FO8I.mp4,We think children are going to be fairly protected from severe disease.
3675,gI85Af-FO8I.mp4,There is a question about are immunocompromised population.
3676,gI85Af-FO8I.mp4,So we do want to protect them just as we want to protect our elderly population.
3677,gI85Af-FO8I.mp4,"Everyone remembering to do lots of hand-washing avoid touching your faith which can be very difficult for children, especially young children."
3678,gI85Af-FO8I.mp4,But if the adults are protecting themselves and those ways it can also help to protect our children the data that we get from Italy and from other countries that have already experienced a surge even from Seattle will be very helpful for us in the future to know exactly how children in America will be affected.
3679,wbnFecqUS30.mp4,For some asthma is a minor nuisance for others.
3680,wbnFecqUS30.mp4,It is a major problem that can interfere with daily activities and may lead to a life-threatening asthma attack.
3681,wbnFecqUS30.mp4,We sat down with dr. Praveen boodikka The Allergy and Immunology specialist at the Family Allergy Asthma Clinic in Fresno.
3682,wbnFecqUS30.mp4,He tells you what you need to know about asthma and tips you can do daily to help prevent any flare-ups.
3683,wbnFecqUS30.mp4,Asthma is basically inflammation or allergies.
3684,wbnFecqUS30.mp4,"He's in the lungs one would know that they have asthma if they have a significant cough that is started, especially at nights, especially in kids and the Pediatric population."
3685,wbnFecqUS30.mp4,"We see this but where the parents come in and let us know that oh, my child has been coughing all night long."
3686,wbnFecqUS30.mp4,"I call it the 72-hour rule where if you don't come in within 72 hours, you're going to the emergency room because it As my is forgiving initially for the first 24 to 36 hours."
3687,wbnFecqUS30.mp4,"And that's when you should seek care some of the common things that trigger asthma are basically dust mite pollen poetry pollen grass pollen in the air dust mite, especially in the carpets anything that sets off inflammation sets off."
3688,wbnFecqUS30.mp4,"Asthma covid-19 is inflammatory trigger, so therefore it is Fair to say that it is a trigger for asthma."
3689,wbnFecqUS30.mp4,Asthma by itself is caused by allergies 85% of ozma has allergic triggers.
3690,wbnFecqUS30.mp4,"So if you have dust mite available dust mite exposure, if you have tree pollen exposure grass pollen exposure weeds are mold pollen and mold spores exposure."
3691,wbnFecqUS30.mp4,You're going to see a lot of Triggers for asthma and our goal here in my clinic found the allergy Adam Clinic is to First identify.
3692,wbnFecqUS30.mp4,What are these triggers that occur causing your asthma once we identify him?
3693,wbnFecqUS30.mp4,That's the most important part.
3694,wbnFecqUS30.mp4,"They are other things to mitigate allergies and Asthma and that's very simple at you can do this at home is nasal rinse has just to clean out this especially at the end of the day or early in the morning before you go go to work or it's to basically use a nasal rinse just to take out all the pollen and all the dust that triggers asthma from the nose in the area are allergies from the nose, you know, which eventually Cascades down to asthma"

3726,47BsMx70O4g.mp4,Let's ask from a consumer angle what we're supposed to do.
3727,47BsMx70O4g.mp4,I'm sitting here thinking I remember at the height of this thing going to the grocery store and not seeing toilet paper.
3728,47BsMx70O4g.mp4,What have you and ever since then?
3729,47BsMx70O4g.mp4,I've become a squirrel.
3730,47BsMx70O4g.mp4,Like I'll see you.
3731,47BsMx70O4g.mp4,"I'm seriously like I'll see you know, toilet paper hand sanitizer and my husband's like Chanel Marie like we have two drawers full of you know, let's use the toilet paper we have now, seriously."
3732,47BsMx70O4g.mp4,I don't know a lot of people can relate to that and we don't want to do that again.
3733,47BsMx70O4g.mp4,"No, I don't want a repeat of what we saw in the spring not at all, but I do want people to be prepared."
3734,47BsMx70O4g.mp4,So let's start in your medicine.
3735,47BsMx70O4g.mp4,"In cabinet, you may already have some of these things especially if your Chanel over-the-counter cold and flu remedies, right you want to make sure you check the expiration dates."
3736,47BsMx70O4g.mp4,Don't forget about the children's pain relievers and fluids as well.
3737,47BsMx70O4g.mp4,Definitely want a working thermometer heading into this potential twin demick.
3738,47BsMx70O4g.mp4,And then let's move over to your pantry good idea to have about two weeks worth of food.
3739,47BsMx70O4g.mp4,So that in case we see slowdowns and grocery deliveries or hopefully not but another shutdown of food stores you have enough to get your family through for two weeks with non-perishable goods and canned Woods those are the important things that you really need to be worried about and making sure that you have no need to hoard.
3740,47BsMx70O4g.mp4,We are seeing plenty of paper products back in the stores disinfectant wipes as well.
3741,47BsMx70O4g.mp4,But there are some limits on those.
3742,47BsMx70O4g.mp4,"So one of our viewers and Texas said what she does is she just picks up a couple extra items on each grocery trip, and then she just has enough for what she needs if that's a good tip."
3743,47BsMx70O4g.mp4,That's a good idea another I think important topic.
3744,47BsMx70O4g.mp4,I was out this weekend people love to eat outside.
3745,47BsMx70O4g.mp4,"It's crowded, right?"
3746,47BsMx70O4g.mp4,So is it one of those things where we need to start reeling that in when it gets a little cooler is it?
3747,47BsMx70O4g.mp4,"Fine since we're outside, you know, do we need to start having conversations with our employers like is it time to kind of perk up a little bit things are going to change as we all start to having to move indoors whether it's your kids in school or you're going back to the office."
3748,47BsMx70O4g.mp4,This is really the time to have the conversation if you haven't already with your employer about whether working from home continues to be an option for you if it doesn't ask about staggering your hours so that perhaps you can come in on off peak hours.
3749,47BsMx70O4g.mp4,You're not sharing your work space or building with as many people that will also help you avoid commuting and being in small.
3750,47BsMx70O4g.mp4,Mess with people during rush hour that's important in the classroom.
3751,47BsMx70O4g.mp4,This is as you heard.
3752,47BsMx70O4g.mp4,Dr. John Torres say ventilation is everything so asked if the teachers can keep the windows and doors open parents also might want to consider buying room air purifiers or cleaners for their classrooms.
3753,47BsMx70O4g.mp4,That's something that schools will need this year.
3754,47BsMx70O4g.mp4,Especially the older schools that may not have those great air handling units.
3755,47BsMx70O4g.mp4,"Let's squeeze in one more and that's for a lot of people who are you know, we're thinking long-term medical procedures the mammograms the doctor's appointments that you've been putting off, you know, all those things what What's your best advice?"
3756,47BsMx70O4g.mp4,Don't delay get in now.
3757,47BsMx70O4g.mp4,You definitely don't want to be going to the hospital for a procedure during the peak of cold flu and potentially covid-19 season.
3758,47BsMx70O4g.mp4,"So get those appointments taken care of now and I hate to say this but consider your holiday shopping list, and maybe you want to start chipping away at it now now I know you're an early bird, but the early bird gets the worm this year think about it unprecedented demand for online shopping and you also don't really want to be in crowded indoor malls."
3759,47BsMx70O4g.mp4,So start planning early something there is about
3760,78jLBNSqc3g.mp4,The coronavirus which causes covid-19 originated in the city of Wuhan China.
3761,78jLBNSqc3g.mp4,Covid-19 is believed to be transmitted primarily through inhalation.
3762,78jLBNSqc3g.mp4,"Once infected most people experience mild symptoms, including sore throat headache fever a dry cough shortness of breath and fatigue."
3763,78jLBNSqc3g.mp4,"However, in a subset of patients the virus attacks the lungs causing a much more serious infection."
3764,78jLBNSqc3g.mp4,Small air sacs in the lungs add oxygen to your blood cells.
3765,78jLBNSqc3g.mp4,This oxygen is then transported to organs and tissues throughout the body when the coronavirus attaches to a cell it begins to replicate within the cell the body's immune system attempts to destroy the virus which results in an inflammatory response that causes fluid accumulation in the lungs as the lungs fill with fluid the bodies available oxygen.
3766,78jLBNSqc3g.mp4,"Decreases which can lead to organ injury and death the risk of serious complications increases if a person is elderly or has Associated medical conditions once infected a person may show no symptoms, but can still infect others."
3767,78jLBNSqc3g.mp4,What began in Wuhan has now spread across the globe.
3768,0MjsEvN3VOs.mp4,In terms of covid-19 and stroke in the brain and neurologic signs.
3769,0MjsEvN3VOs.mp4,There are a few.
3770,0MjsEvN3VOs.mp4,Neurological symptoms that are pretty clearly associated with caused by covid.
3771,0MjsEvN3VOs.mp4,Most interesting one is loss of smell not everyone gets the loss of smell.
3772,0MjsEvN3VOs.mp4,but if an otherwise Normal person had previously had not had any trouble with pasters.
3773,0MjsEvN3VOs.mp4,Well develops that loss of stuff then that's worth looking at possible coding other things can make you lose some the question comes up is is covid call stroke.
3774,0MjsEvN3VOs.mp4,The answer is very rarely.
3775,0MjsEvN3VOs.mp4,And those are patients that are very sick.
3776,0MjsEvN3VOs.mp4,Those are the those are these severe patients in a hospital usually in an intensive care unit.
3777,0MjsEvN3VOs.mp4,These are mostly patients that had previous.
3778,0MjsEvN3VOs.mp4,illness high blood pressures most common other vascular disease heart failure then they get septic.
3779,0MjsEvN3VOs.mp4,"When you get septic, that means that the infection whatever infection is overwhelms your system."
3780,0MjsEvN3VOs.mp4,Those patients can then can get hypotension low blood pressure.
3781,0MjsEvN3VOs.mp4,We think patients that have stroke late in the disease severe elderly.
3782,0MjsEvN3VOs.mp4,Those Strokes are probably related to the sepsis.
3783,0MjsEvN3VOs.mp4,"So yeah, it's from the covid-19, but it's because the patient is septic."
3784,0MjsEvN3VOs.mp4,You come to the ER and the patient comes to the ER previously healthy with a stroke.
3785,0MjsEvN3VOs.mp4,Chances that being covid-19 are very very rare.
3786,0MjsEvN3VOs.mp4,Strokes are late manifestation of severe septic disease with Kofi.
3787,0MjsEvN3VOs.mp4,Now another neurologic Sam you see is muscle pain.
3788,0MjsEvN3VOs.mp4,Is that can occur fairly early?
3789,0MjsEvN3VOs.mp4,You could get dizziness fairly early from covid-19.
3790,0MjsEvN3VOs.mp4,Too kind of the early symptoms.
3791,0MjsEvN3VOs.mp4,Also smell muscle aches disease maybe a forewarning that you're getting coated.
3792,0MjsEvN3VOs.mp4,But the bad symptoms of stroke and sepsis death shocked.
3793,0MjsEvN3VOs.mp4,Those are late in the disease.
3794,0MjsEvN3VOs.mp4,Don't worry about stroke worry about keeping 6 feet between you and your neighbors washing your hands every time you turn around.
3795,0MjsEvN3VOs.mp4,We're going to ask when you're out in the bucket.
3796,0MjsEvN3VOs.mp4,Stay healthy.
3797,HbhmHjN6qZ8.mp4,We're starting to see more and more about the disease process itself and who's affected and who's at high risk while everyone is at risk of getting the coronavirus.
3798,HbhmHjN6qZ8.mp4,Some people are more likely than others to become severely ill the Center for Disease Control and prevention recently updated its list of underlying medical conditions that increase this risk funny up these chronic diseases particularly chronic kidney disease COPD obesity defined by BMI greater than 30 coronary artery disease.
3799,HbhmHjN6qZ8.mp4,These heart failure sickle cell anemia type 2 diabetes and any immune compromised State such as a transplant Doctor James Frazier with Norton Healthcare says other conditions that might increase a person's risk of severe illness include asthma cystic fibrosis hypertension liver disease smoking and pregnancy more likely to potentially be hospitalized during their pregnancy.
3800,HbhmHjN6qZ8.mp4,If they get the disease the CDC estimates that 60 percent of American adults have at least one chronic condition.
3801,HbhmHjN6qZ8.mp4,And that increases risk for severe illness.
3802,HbhmHjN6qZ8.mp4,Dr. Fraiser says those people should take extra precautions wearing a mask while you're out in public cloth mask is fine clean and disinfect your area these new additions come as more reports and studies are being completed across the country look around and people are closing these studies and submitting their data to National journal's that were finding that these risk factors are real Alex Durham WLKY News.
3803,bvS7gnEkoxE.mp4,Welcome to impact factor your weekly dose of commentary on a new medical study.
3804,bvS7gnEkoxE.mp4,I'm dr. F Prairie Wilson of the Yale School of Medicine in the early days of the coronavirus pandemic the phrase flatten the curve got into the national Zeitgeist by shutting down large aspects of society social distancing and other public health measures.
3805,bvS7gnEkoxE.mp4,We would slow the spread of the coronavirus to avoid overwhelming our hospital system Grim stories from Italy.
3806,bvS7gnEkoxE.mp4,Lee of triaging ventilators and patients dying in corridors made the problem that much more real and so far it seems we have flattened the curve we have not had to deny life-saving treatments because ventilators or ICU beds were not available.
3807,bvS7gnEkoxE.mp4,"This was due in no small part to Herculean efforts on the part of healthcare workers to expand capacity, but also to the efforts of everyday Americans who took the precautions, seriously one question has been sitting in the back of my mind since the talk of curve flattening started."
3808,bvS7gnEkoxE.mp4,Does everyone get the coronavirus eventually?
3809,bvS7gnEkoxE.mp4,It's an important question.
3810,bvS7gnEkoxE.mp4,This is a novel virus for which none of us are likely to have any existing Community.
3811,bvS7gnEkoxE.mp4,We are ripe for infection and the rate of spread without social distancing is rapid the presence of asymptomatic spread makes the situation even worse.
3812,bvS7gnEkoxE.mp4,"Of course, the more people get it the more people become immune and the harder it is for the virus to continue to spread the equation to calculate the percent of the population who needs to be immune to confer broad herd immunity is pretty Straightforward it's 1 minus the inverse of are not if each person with the disease infects three others, for example, then once two out of three people are immune to the disease doesn't have enough targets to keep spreading."
3813,bvS7gnEkoxE.mp4,I made a graph showing the relationship between the are not and the population percentage necessary to confer herd immunity here for covid-19.
3814,bvS7gnEkoxE.mp4,We probably have to have 65% to 70% of the population immune before the thing dies out.
3815,bvS7gnEkoxE.mp4,I'll just point out.
3816,bvS7gnEkoxE.mp4,We are nowhere close to that.
3817,bvS7gnEkoxE.mp4,Even in New York City American epicenter of the disease Sero prevalence studies only suggest about 25% of the population is immune if our battle against coronavirus has baseball game were somewhere in the second inning.
3818,bvS7gnEkoxE.mp4,But if 65% of us are going to get it eventually then you can make a particularly utilitarian and somewhat strange argument about our Public Health measures.
3819,bvS7gnEkoxE.mp4,"Maybe we should flatten the curve just enough to avoid overwhelming our hospitals, but no more get through this as quickly as possible."
3820,bvS7gnEkoxE.mp4,Without leading to excess deaths it even gives a quantifiable metric to score the government's response.
3821,bvS7gnEkoxE.mp4,As long as a single person doesn't get denied care because of hospital overcrowding.
3822,bvS7gnEkoxE.mp4,It's a victory.
3823,bvS7gnEkoxE.mp4,"There's a lot of peeling about this argument, but I want to deconstruct it a bit from a practical epidemiological and ethical perspective first the Practical delaying the spread of the disease doesn't only help hospitals cope with surges it also buys us time to do medical research identify treatments and find vaccines and I want to point out that this isn't all In the sky maybe we'll have a large randomized clinical trial of a new drug This is highly practical stuff as we figure out how to treat covid-19 think how much we've learned in these few months about the utility of pronating about delay of intubation about the risk of thrombosis that is changing how we care for these patients."
3824,bvS7gnEkoxE.mp4,You're way better off getting sick from coronavirus.
3825,bvS7gnEkoxE.mp4,"Now, then you were in March another practical issue is that there's really no way to just skirt under overwhelming our hospitals."
3826,bvS7gnEkoxE.mp4,We can't just dial up and I'll down the disease spread.
3827,bvS7gnEkoxE.mp4,It's different in different places and substantially lags policy choices.
3828,bvS7gnEkoxE.mp4,There's also a stochastic element here outbreaks will happen and they will not be predictable second the epidemiological it turns out that outbreaks.
3829,bvS7gnEkoxE.mp4,Don't just stop when you reach herd immunity.
3830,bvS7gnEkoxE.mp4,They have inertia.
3831,bvS7gnEkoxE.mp4,Here's dr. Albert co-chair of Wales Department of epidemiology of microbial diseases.
3832,bvS7gnEkoxE.mp4,You can overshoot predicted herd immunity.
3833,bvS7gnEkoxE.mp4,"That's just because of the Dynamics, you know when you have You know such high transmission are attack rates, finally the ethical even if we assume the total death rate is the same which I hope at this point I've convinced you is not the case compressing those deaths into a shorter period of time still robs people of life."
3834,bvS7gnEkoxE.mp4,I mean look a hundred percent of people die eventually as Physicians.
3835,bvS7gnEkoxE.mp4,The war against death is one we will always lose but we fight the battle to push that day as far into the future as possible.
3836,bvS7gnEkoxE.mp4,I think we need to keep that in mind as we continue to struggle with covid-19.
3837,bvS7gnEkoxE.mp4,Everyday is a victory.
3838,bvS7gnEkoxE.mp4,"For Medscape, I'm Perry Wilson."
3839,oPVmd6MSE58.mp4,Good morning.
3840,oPVmd6MSE58.mp4,This is dr.
3841,oPVmd6MSE58.mp4,"Shot 30th of October 20, 20 today's topic covid-19 vaccine a few facts fact."
3842,oPVmd6MSE58.mp4,Number one.
3843,oPVmd6MSE58.mp4,The first vaccine to arrive in India probably will be a vaccine created out of the Oxford AstraZeneca trial in UK vaccine manufactured by serum Institute of India and branded as Covey Shield.
3844,oPVmd6MSE58.mp4,This vaccine may arrive by January 2021 if the trial results are approved by authorities fact number two other vaccines will arrive in India probably by the second or third quarter of 2020. fact number three or nasal vaccine intranasal vaccine may arrive by the end of next year manufactured by serum Institute again code regenexx is the company in the US which is doing Trials of this vaccine a nasal vaccine will be probably more efficacious than the injectable vaccine.
3845,oPVmd6MSE58.mp4,fact number 4 the safety profile of the vaccine should be good.
3846,oPVmd6MSE58.mp4,Should we satisfactory should be probably equivalent to the safety profile of say the flu vaccine fact number 5 the efficacy profile may not be remarkable.
3847,oPVmd6MSE58.mp4,Meaning if the vaccine is given hundred people maybe 50% will be protected 50 will not these 50 with who are protected maze develop good b or T Cell immunity which can last Four months but 50% efficacy is not greater efficacy.
3848,oPVmd6MSE58.mp4,Six the dosing will be two doses of the vaccine injectable vaccine usually four weeks apart.
3849,oPVmd6MSE58.mp4,Fact number 7 the vaccine will be first available to fewer people and not everybody because the number of doses will be available will be less.
3850,oPVmd6MSE58.mp4,Remember CMS issued has already made several million Doses and they are lying in storage waiting to be shipped after approval but not enough doses will be available for everybody and Logistics is such a huge problem right now because storage is at 70° and that kind of storage is not available easily.
3851,oPVmd6MSE58.mp4,So I don't know what will happen in semi Urban or rural India.
3852,oPVmd6MSE58.mp4,fact number 8 The vaccine is the only way we can reach her immunity.
3853,oPVmd6MSE58.mp4,So those Skeptics or non-believers who think that they will not take the vaccine even if it is if it arrives should take the vaccine for two reasons one.
3854,oPVmd6MSE58.mp4,It liberates you if it is efficacious and 50% is not a bad number even if it's 50% People argue that an n95 mask protects 95% of the people whether the vaccine will protect half that number.
3855,oPVmd6MSE58.mp4,Absolutely agreed the n95 mask is a magical thing.
3856,oPVmd6MSE58.mp4,It will protect you but you can't live all your life with an n95 mask second reason to take the vaccine is the vaccine is the only way to go for herd immunity and we need that to end the pandemic so vaccinate yourself and do advise the vaccine when it is available.
3857,oPVmd6MSE58.mp4,Thank you.

3893,Xaw8DsF2Igc.mp4,"If you're at home, make sure you carefully read the instructions on returning your test kit and registering your test before you begin if you're worried about anything or your child asks you to stop please stop."
3894,Xaw8DsF2Igc.mp4,Prepare to take the sample.
3895,Xaw8DsF2Igc.mp4,And sure that both of you have washed your hands thoroughly for 20 seconds using soap and warm water.

3897,Xaw8DsF2Igc.mp4,Talk your child through what is going to happen?
3898,Xaw8DsF2Igc.mp4,It may be helpful to give younger children a video to watch.
3899,Xaw8DsF2Igc.mp4,It may even be a good idea to suggest a reward of some kind after taking a test.
3900,Xaw8DsF2Igc.mp4,Check your testing kit.
3901,Xaw8DsF2Igc.mp4,Your kit should include a sheet of barcode labels a swap inside a sealed wrapper a sample tube containing a small amount of liquid an absorbent pad a plastic resealable bag a biohazard bag with a silver seal.
3902,Xaw8DsF2Igc.mp4,And if you are completing your test at home a return package and return label be aware that testing kits May differ so follow the instructions and closed.
3903,Xaw8DsF2Igc.mp4,Taking the test.
3904,Xaw8DsF2Igc.mp4,Make your child comfortable and secure if possible have the child's sit on someone's lap or have someone else hold their hand ask your child to gently blow their nose into a tissue throw the tissue away in a bin open the package and gently take out the swab.
3905,Xaw8DsF2Igc.mp4,This will be used for both throat and nose.
3906,Xaw8DsF2Igc.mp4,Take care not to touch the soft end of the Swap and anything apart from the throat and nose.
3907,Xaw8DsF2Igc.mp4,the throat swab look inside your child's mouth get them to say are really loudly for 5 seconds.
3908,Xaw8DsF2Igc.mp4,So you can see the back of the throat.
3909,Xaw8DsF2Igc.mp4,This is the area where you will swap.
3910,Xaw8DsF2Igc.mp4,Holding the swab in your hand gently rub it over the back of the throat for 10 seconds.
3911,Xaw8DsF2Igc.mp4,This may be quite uncomfortable.
3912,Xaw8DsF2Igc.mp4,So you can ask your child to say are really loudly three times then introduce the swab and ask them to keep saying our whilst.
3913,Xaw8DsF2Igc.mp4,The swab test is conducted.
3914,Xaw8DsF2Igc.mp4,"If you are unable to get a throat sample, please do to nostrils instead."
3915,Xaw8DsF2Igc.mp4,Then remove the swab from the mouth avoid contact with anything else.
3916,Xaw8DsF2Igc.mp4,the nasal swab put the same end of the same swab gently into the nostril until you begin to feel resistance rotate the swab for 10 to 15 seconds then slowly remove.

3924,Xaw8DsF2Igc.mp4,Thank you for getting tested.
3925,SyUd0G2-PEo.mp4,The federal government is launching a nationwide app to ramp up contact tracing.
3926,SyUd0G2-PEo.mp4,Led by the Canadian digital service and with the help of Shopify blackberry and the government of Ontario.
3927,SyUd0G2-PEo.mp4,We've been working on a nationwide mobile app that will notify users if they've been exposed to covid-19.
3928,SyUd0G2-PEo.mp4,We will soon begin testing this app in Ontario.
3929,SyUd0G2-PEo.mp4,There are already a number of other provinces including BC who are working with us on this but it will be available to everyone in the coming weeks.
3930,SyUd0G2-PEo.mp4,So the Prime Minister stressed the app is completely voluntary and the personal information will not be shared.
3931,SyUd0G2-PEo.mp4,He added the app success will depend on how many people choose to use it.
3932,SyUd0G2-PEo.mp4,So for more on this were joined by an Kabuki and the former three-term privacy Commissioner of Ontario.
3933,SyUd0G2-PEo.mp4,Thank you so much for joining us.
3934,SyUd0G2-PEo.mp4,Thank you Anthony.
3935,SyUd0G2-PEo.mp4,What is your feeling with this app?
3936,SyUd0G2-PEo.mp4,I'm delighted that our app here in Canada.
3937,SyUd0G2-PEo.mp4,Especially in Ontario is being built on top of the Apple Google framework Apple and Google partnered together to develop an app that is totally privacy protective and believe me.
3938,SyUd0G2-PEo.mp4,I always say trust but verify always look under the hood.
3939,SyUd0G2-PEo.mp4,Apple has briefed me on two separate occasions on all the amazing measures that are available in this total privacy.
3940,SyUd0G2-PEo.mp4,It's decentralized no personal information.
3941,SyUd0G2-PEo.mp4,Is collected or retained your geolocation data not collected or retained its totally privacy protective and this is critical.
3942,SyUd0G2-PEo.mp4,You see people can choose it's all voluntary.
3943,SyUd0G2-PEo.mp4,You can choose to opt in to download the app and feel secure that this at information isn't going anywhere.
3944,SyUd0G2-PEo.mp4,It's under your control privacy is all about personal control.
3945,SyUd0G2-PEo.mp4,You can control if you want to share it with anyone and I should point out Apple Google.
3946,SyUd0G2-PEo.mp4,Are not calling this a contact tracing app because they don't want to trace you or track you or engage in surveillance.
3947,SyUd0G2-PEo.mp4,It's called an exposure notification app.
3948,SyUd0G2-PEo.mp4,So that means that it will notify you when you've been exposed to someone who has also self reported as being covid-19 positive.
3949,SyUd0G2-PEo.mp4,That way you can choose to pursue care go to your doctor or go to a public health authority Etc.
3950,SyUd0G2-PEo.mp4,It's a total wimp.
3951,SyUd0G2-PEo.mp4,"Now it leads to a lot of questions, but this is a strong endorsement because you have been Advocate for people's privacy for many years in terms of what is on there and the data this is erased after 14 days, correct?"
3952,SyUd0G2-PEo.mp4,Absolutely.
3953,SyUd0G2-PEo.mp4,And also it uses Bluetooth beacons which change every 15 minutes.
3954,SyUd0G2-PEo.mp4,So it's not that someone could locate you because there's an identifier on the phone.
3955,SyUd0G2-PEo.mp4,"No, it's constantly revolving and any metadata arising from the Bluetooth are also encrypted using AES which is very strongly protected."
3956,SyUd0G2-PEo.mp4,"I should point out Germany adopted the Apple Google framework and their contact tracing up which were they released three days ago and within 24 hours, they have six point five million people downloaded and and start using it is huge."
3957,SyUd0G2-PEo.mp4,"And I think this just goes to show the level of trust of that is needed Germany stands by the Apple Google framework, which is why they used it."
3958,SyUd0G2-PEo.mp4,"All right and the fact that our Province here Ontario has a dog Did it it's complete exposure notification, no tracing or tracking whatsoever."
3959,SyUd0G2-PEo.mp4,Now given that it's voluntary.
3960,SyUd0G2-PEo.mp4,How effective do you think this will be overall because this does depend on people actually downloading and using it you're right actually and that's why trust is so important.
3961,SyUd0G2-PEo.mp4,That's one of the reasons Apple went to Great Lengths to briefly extensively to so that to convince me that this is in fact a very privacy protective app.
3962,SyUd0G2-PEo.mp4,Usually I'm very critical of Of technology and absent and I warned people to stay away from it in this particular instance.
3963,SyUd0G2-PEo.mp4,I'm hoping that people can trust the framework because I have examined it and it will not reveal any information.
3964,SyUd0G2-PEo.mp4,It is totally decentralized.
3965,SyUd0G2-PEo.mp4,It allows you to be in control of the information that you wish to share.
3966,SyUd0G2-PEo.mp4,If you do if you don't that's fine.
3967,SyUd0G2-PEo.mp4,"You can also turn, you know, get rid of it."
3968,SyUd0G2-PEo.mp4,"Any time everything is under your personal control, which is what privacy All about certainly a different story than what's happening in a lot of other countries like Norway, which is pulling back from its privacy app, which is we have to clarify."
3969,SyUd0G2-PEo.mp4,It's different than this one.
3970,SyUd0G2-PEo.mp4,Correct.
3971,SyUd0G2-PEo.mp4,Totally totally.
3972,SyUd0G2-PEo.mp4,It's not privacy protective at all.
3973,SyUd0G2-PEo.mp4,And I should also point out that a number of jurisdictions which started with a more invasive contact tracing app Australia the UK there are changing to the Apple Google framework.
3974,SyUd0G2-PEo.mp4,"We're going to have to leave it there and Kabuki in the former three-term privacy Commissioner of Ontario, we really appreciate your Insight and your time this morning, my pleasure."
3975,SyUd0G2-PEo.mp4,Thank you.
3976,OQ99yUDepIs.mp4,Keeping her side business running was all about changing gears for Renee Welch when the pandemic hit she went from making satin lined knitted hat to multi-layered masks.
3977,OQ99yUDepIs.mp4,I had a bunch of scrap fabric at home.
3978,OQ99yUDepIs.mp4,So I decided just to make some Mass to donate to hospitals her business has blossomed since then.
3979,OQ99yUDepIs.mp4,She now makes Mass with three layers after doing her research.
3980,OQ99yUDepIs.mp4,I wasn't going to sell something that I knew wasn't.Going to be saved.
3981,OQ99yUDepIs.mp4,Fabric Mass should ideally have three layers.
3982,OQ99yUDepIs.mp4,The World Health Organization has been recommending this multi-layered approach for months.
3983,OQ99yUDepIs.mp4,Now yet Canada's top doctor only made that call yesterday.
3984,OQ99yUDepIs.mp4,The government says it does its own analysis on what's right for Canadians.
3985,OQ99yUDepIs.mp4,And now that's adding a third layer if possible.
3986,OQ99yUDepIs.mp4,"One of the kind of filter material is nonwoven polypropylene, which is like an interface."
3987,OQ99yUDepIs.mp4,I don't know people who so I don't but now I've learned about interfacing that kind of material can be inserted.
3988,OQ99yUDepIs.mp4,This doctor has researched the effectiveness of cloth masks.
3989,OQ99yUDepIs.mp4,She says getting this material from retailers can prove to be tricky.
3990,OQ99yUDepIs.mp4,We have to be careful when were buying polypropylene because some polypropylene is that sold for stiffening will actually already be pre-glued to make it easy to use but that glue is not part of the filtration process and it's not part of what is intended here intentions aside this infection control.
3991,OQ99yUDepIs.mp4,The demonologist says the new recommendation is adding to the confusion important question in Canada is can you please put on a mask as opposed to how is that mask constructed?
3992,OQ99yUDepIs.mp4,"So this size this one is construction continues for Welch who was surprised to hear that the government is only now recommending what she's been doing for months mock together tassel a CBC News, Toronto."
3993,g_O2AS7P_jg.mp4,First time I went in I was at work and I had a stroke like symptoms.
3994,g_O2AS7P_jg.mp4,I couldn't remember any anything within the last few minutes went to the ER and they did a bunch of tests MRI CAT scan EKG thinking I was having a stroke and suspect covid at all.
3995,g_O2AS7P_jg.mp4,About two or three days later.
3996,g_O2AS7P_jg.mp4,I started having fever chills aches and then they had me come in for a covid test the test came back positive for covid.
3997,g_O2AS7P_jg.mp4,I didn't really have any breathing problems at the time.
3998,g_O2AS7P_jg.mp4,So I was just kind of thinking I would get over it like a flu and a few days but shortly after that became harder and harder to breathe and then too hard to breathe on my own.
3999,g_O2AS7P_jg.mp4,"So I went to the hospital have a history of asthma I guess it would be pretty bad as a child, but I hadn't had any real serious symptoms as an adult for probably 10 years."
4000,g_O2AS7P_jg.mp4,"They put me on a high-flow oxygen not the ventilator yet, but I've L'Occitane worked for a day or two, but then like my oxygen saturation just plummeted."
4001,g_O2AS7P_jg.mp4,And I eventually I needed the ventilator when they called me to say that he was going to go on the ventilator.
4002,g_O2AS7P_jg.mp4,That was scary.
4003,g_O2AS7P_jg.mp4,Because the only experience that I had you know was some years ago when my grandfather died and was on a ventilator and you think of it as the end.
4004,g_O2AS7P_jg.mp4,"I felt alone, you know, like now I have to make these kind of decisions for our family and I'm not ready."
4005,g_O2AS7P_jg.mp4,It wasn't emotionally ready.
4006,g_O2AS7P_jg.mp4,First time.
4007,g_O2AS7P_jg.mp4,I was on the ventilator was 14 days when I came off for a day or two and and and I kind of crashed again and had to go back on the ventilator second time for two more days.
4008,g_O2AS7P_jg.mp4,So total of 25 days.
4009,g_O2AS7P_jg.mp4,Seeing a guy who is relatively healthy.
4010,g_O2AS7P_jg.mp4,I have friends and family in the community who do Peak physique with this guy tons of nursing staff and staff at the hospital who were just cheering for this guy rooting for him.
4011,g_O2AS7P_jg.mp4,"So my goal was, you know convince this guy he's strong enough that it's more of a mental game at this point to stay focused stay calm, but you're also talking to someone who's sedated."
4012,g_O2AS7P_jg.mp4,So how much of that is getting through to him.
4013,g_O2AS7P_jg.mp4,How much is the understanding was kind of the obstacle.
4014,g_O2AS7P_jg.mp4,We got to the point.
4015,g_O2AS7P_jg.mp4,I just educated them.
4016,g_O2AS7P_jg.mp4,"Hey, we're going to take that tube out."
4017,g_O2AS7P_jg.mp4,De lo and behold he made it through the night.
4018,g_O2AS7P_jg.mp4,I came in.
4019,g_O2AS7P_jg.mp4,I was worried.
4020,g_O2AS7P_jg.mp4,"I went home and I was actually worried sick like God if this guy gets intubated again, it's going to be a very poor outcome turns out he was doing well started doing better as far as breathing oxygenation."
4021,g_O2AS7P_jg.mp4,What an impressive story a courageous story taught himself fighting the fight but then a huge team effort.
4022,g_O2AS7P_jg.mp4,I was caring for Todd in the moment where he was really just starting to turn the corner had been through a very very challenging course and Is really starting to improve it was hard because can you imagine life being one way to start and then being critically ill for an extended period of time Todd's an inspiration and I pleasure to be involved in his care.
4023,g_O2AS7P_jg.mp4,"It's energizing gives you a new phone, maybe like a second wind or some motivation saying hey not everyone is going to die from this virus and no matter how sick they are."
4024,g_O2AS7P_jg.mp4,"You know, they can still make a recovery and seeing them kind of go through it and decline in Decline and then finally, you know get off."
4025,g_O2AS7P_jg.mp4,Unit it was you know small celebration.
4026,g_O2AS7P_jg.mp4,I think I chalk it up as a W for the team.
4027,g_O2AS7P_jg.mp4,So I'm going through Physical Therapy occupational therapy and speech therapy every week.
4028,g_O2AS7P_jg.mp4,"So I'm working on my strength doing some lifting weight lifting because I probably about 70% of my strength before all this happened very lucky and blessed, you know, most people are affected minimally with by this but you know, If you have any kind of a underlying condition or I've had it in the past you could you just don't know such a such a crazy virus that you could be a healthy one day and and you know in the hospital and next day just don't know and you don't know if you're spreading it to others because it's kind of a silent disease."
4029,g_O2AS7P_jg.mp4,"Certainly the odds are better if you're younger, but they're not zero and if you contract the illness, there's a percentage chance that it could be very very hard on you like it was on Todd it only affects a small percentage."
4030,g_O2AS7P_jg.mp4,"But if you're in that percentage, that's like that's a huge thing."
4031,g_O2AS7P_jg.mp4,"And I think that you know, it's not it's not a hoax."
4032,g_O2AS7P_jg.mp4,It's not made-up.
4033,g_O2AS7P_jg.mp4,"I mean real people are getting sick and dying and we have to you know be smart and you know, do what we can to take care of each other."

4037,ZNAONc3wqCo.mp4,"Yeah, you know the more we test the more we know who is positive and who is negative today."
4038,ZNAONc3wqCo.mp4,"I spoke with three people who tested positive for covid-19, all three of them presented different symptoms."
4039,ZNAONc3wqCo.mp4,This symptom I've noticed was shortness of breath.
4040,ZNAONc3wqCo.mp4,And actually I probably dismissed it because I felt it as I was going to bed one evening tonight.
4041,ZNAONc3wqCo.mp4,We're hearing from people who say they tested positive for covid-19 and are recovering started to have symptoms of not being able to smell.
4042,ZNAONc3wqCo.mp4,"I thought it was kind of weird wasn't having any of the other normal symptoms of all of them have different experiences with the virus that still remain somewhat of a mystery since that's a Night, I had fevers all the way up till Wednesday night the fever it never went away twenty-nine-year-old Mauricio Hernandez is a resident physician now under quarantine, but he says after five days of feeling awful."
4043,ZNAONc3wqCo.mp4,He's doing better.
4044,ZNAONc3wqCo.mp4,What was the fever broke off?
4045,ZNAONc3wqCo.mp4,I completely I was back to pretty much just the next day.
4046,ZNAONc3wqCo.mp4,I was back to normal life of pretty pretty okay to do anything the next day Robert Morrison 43 also tested positive.
4047,ZNAONc3wqCo.mp4,He says he felt sick after hanging with the group of friends at his place earlier this month all the friends that were with me have either tested positive or are still unable to get tested.
4048,ZNAONc3wqCo.mp4,But certainly we were all just hanging out that weekend and to be able to pass that along so quickly and easily to every single one of us is quite alarming 34 year old Sean Smith.
4049,ZNAONc3wqCo.mp4,"Also under quarantine with his dog Cooper and has a message for people with or without symptoms, you know, you never know."
4050,ZNAONc3wqCo.mp4,"You could be a carrier, you know a lot of the times, you know, You may not feel be experiencing all the same symptoms as in Fever the chills of shakes that doesn't mean that you're not cares and that's why the messaging is so important to stay home until we get an actual good idea of how many cases there are and flattening that curve."
4051,ZNAONc3wqCo.mp4,Also these three gentlemen illustrate a perfect example of how you do not have to be 65 years or older to get covid-19.

4054,PhbuuOYrTp4.mp4,As the severity of the new coronavirus became more clear early this year.
4055,PhbuuOYrTp4.mp4,We were all understandably focused on the immediate situation.
4056,PhbuuOYrTp4.mp4,We focused on the most prominent symptoms the infection and mortality rates and the range of severity among different populations.
4057,PhbuuOYrTp4.mp4,Now in these later months depend emic we need to turn our attention to the long-term effects for some patients.
4058,PhbuuOYrTp4.mp4,That's the topic of this week's Healthcare triage.
4059,PhbuuOYrTp4.mp4,Should you contract the novel coronavirus and eventually recover as most have done you're basically in the clear for a bit right?
4060,PhbuuOYrTp4.mp4,That seems to be the general attitude.
4061,PhbuuOYrTp4.mp4,But we and many others are here to say not so fast.
4062,PhbuuOYrTp4.mp4,It's possible that some people aren't fully recovering from the virus.
4063,PhbuuOYrTp4.mp4,"This idea has been in the periphery for a while especially because other coronavirus has are known to have lasting health effects, but incoming data are pushing it to a more Central focus and raising concern even for those who did not have a severe case of The disease while it is far too early to understand just how long long term symptoms last a researcher and Healthcare triage is own backyard is on top of it."
4064,PhbuuOYrTp4.mp4,Dr. Natalie Lambert an Indiana University is studying covid-19.
4065,PhbuuOYrTp4.mp4,S long haulers individuals who have reported suffering from symptoms for weeks or even months after being diagnosed with the virus.
4066,PhbuuOYrTp4.mp4,Dr. Lambert teamed up with Survivor core a Grassroots movement in the United States dedicated to connecting those affected with covid-19 with the medical and academic researchers.
4067,PhbuuOYrTp4.mp4,"hours working to understand the disease beyond the extended length of symptoms and those individuals some of those symptoms are surprising on their own in a recently released survey report researchers described now familiar symptoms listed by the CDC such as loss of smell or damaged major organs like the heart or lungs, but also currently less recognize symptoms such as hair loss and brain fog similarly long term symptoms for recently reported by researchers from Italy after assessing a hundred and seventy nine patients who had discharged from the hospital following recovery from the virus at approximately 60 days after symptoms have begun only 12.6 percent of patients reported being symptom free whereas 32% had one to two lingering symptoms and 55% had three or more the most commonly reported long term symptoms were fatigued and labored breathing a study published in Jama Cardiology this July found that in a group of 100 German covid-19 patients 60 of them still had inflammation of the heart when image demean of 71 days after testing positive 36 patient supported General exhaustion and shortness of breath that was not present prior to Contracting the virus in contrast to the previous study."
4068,PhbuuOYrTp4.mp4,The majority of these patients had cases that did not require hospitalization meaning long term symptoms are not definitively linked to severe disease only other work has suggested an association between the virus and long-term neurological effects including inflammation of the central nervous system.
4069,PhbuuOYrTp4.mp4,That means the brain and spinal cord.
4070,PhbuuOYrTp4.mp4,Stroke and neuro psychiatric illnesses such as delirium data from the covid symptom study which gathers information from millions of people who submitted by other studies app currently suggest that somewhere between 10 and 15 percent of people don't recover within a couple weeks still way too early to know if a subset of covid-19 patients will go on to endorse some level of chronic illness.
4071,PhbuuOYrTp4.mp4,"And if so, which patients are most at risk, we'll need a lot more time to conduct a lot more studies with a lot more people before we can provide any clear answers the Data, certainly aren't ruling it out though, which is all the more reason to resist getting overly comfortable this early in the game."

4075,PhbuuOYrTp4.mp4,We'd like to really thank a research Associates James Glasgow.
4076,PhbuuOYrTp4.mp4,"Josephovich Josh kissed her and Michael chin, and of course our surgeon Admiral Sam."
4077,2fG4X9WzxVo.mp4,I think the word lockdown itself is quite scary is something that could cause a lot of anxiety and a lot of you know Panic for but to be honest when I did hear we're going to go into lockdown.
4078,2fG4X9WzxVo.mp4,I did sit back and think right.
4079,2fG4X9WzxVo.mp4,What can we do at this time to try and you know make things a bit easier for ourselves and for everybody that's around us.
4080,2fG4X9WzxVo.mp4,So obviously at that time we were not allowed.
4081,2fG4X9WzxVo.mp4,To see family but my thoughts turn straight away to my neighbors.
4082,2fG4X9WzxVo.mp4,So what I did was I wrong to letter to them so every single household on the street and I asked them if anybody needed any kind of help to please get in touch and how have the neighbors responded to that are they've been fantastic honestly and you know what it's brought us so much closer together as a community as a street and I think you know when we first heard about covid-19 and the terms isolation Is used a lot.
4083,2fG4X9WzxVo.mp4,"I found that this whole experience has broken down a lot of barriers between people and especially on our streets being fantastic, you know, there's been people who have been living here for 30 40 years who didn't know a lot of the people on this tree and even though I've been here for eight years."
4084,2fG4X9WzxVo.mp4,"I've now got to know so many more people and that, you know, the atmosphere is just so much better than them."
4085,2fG4X9WzxVo.mp4,Were you worried in terms of how covid-19 was going to impact on on your emotional health and well-being.
4086,2fG4X9WzxVo.mp4,"Yeah, of course because it's such a massive change."
4087,2fG4X9WzxVo.mp4,"It's a huge change for everybody and obviously because of my history of anxiety and you know, I suffered a lot with anxiety during pregnancy and I still got you know, I'm still sort of moving forward with that."
4088,2fG4X9WzxVo.mp4,"But initially, I just thought love we've got to try and take something positive out of this how we can benefit other people at this moment in time and I think that mentality Three is something that has really really helped me get through this and just also getting my family involved."
4089,2fG4X9WzxVo.mp4,My children involved are heavily involved with everything that we're doing with the neighbors and The Wider work as well.
4090,2fG4X9WzxVo.mp4,That's been happening in community a cultural perspective.
4091,2fG4X9WzxVo.mp4,Do you feel and how has it helped you in terms of to deal with anxiety as well.
4092,2fG4X9WzxVo.mp4,"Yeah, so obviously anxiety something that will affect."
4093,2fG4X9WzxVo.mp4,Everybody it doesn't know any religion.
4094,2fG4X9WzxVo.mp4,It doesn't know any culture doesn't know any gender any sexuality anything anxiety and other mental health problems.
4095,2fG4X9WzxVo.mp4,They will affect everybody and for me when I was first diagnosed with anxiety.
4096,2fG4X9WzxVo.mp4,I was very lucky because I had a very supportive family my parents understood.
4097,2fG4X9WzxVo.mp4,My husband was very supportive as well.
4098,2fG4X9WzxVo.mp4,But I know there are a lot of people within our community who might not have that support.
4099,2fG4X9WzxVo.mp4,I think it is really really difficult.
4100,2fG4X9WzxVo.mp4,"But when you are already going through so much and facing anxiety, then on top of that having to try and explain to people that you don't feel well that you don't feel well within yourself that you know might need help and I think it is so important that we you know Embrace these issues and we really really need to open up and have these conversations."
4101,2fG4X9WzxVo.mp4,Have you still felt connected to Muslim communities?
4102,2fG4X9WzxVo.mp4,"Well, because I know you're very proud to be a Muslim."
4103,2fG4X9WzxVo.mp4,Obviously when lockdown happened.
4104,2fG4X9WzxVo.mp4,One of the first announcement was that and places of worship will be clothed and then during covid-19.
4105,2fG4X9WzxVo.mp4,We've had Ramadan which was a whole month which would have been such a spiritual time for us connecting with family connecting the community going to the mosque.
4106,2fG4X9WzxVo.mp4,So obviously this year we weren't able to do that.
4107,2fG4X9WzxVo.mp4,"But on, you know, I tried to look at it positively."
4108,2fG4X9WzxVo.mp4,"So, okay."
4109,2fG4X9WzxVo.mp4,That's something we can't do.
4110,2fG4X9WzxVo.mp4,What can we do?
4111,2fG4X9WzxVo.mp4,"So in you know from my personal experience, we all got together as a street all the Muslims on the street people were casting we all got together and we surprised our non Muslim neighbors and we make them all helpers."
4112,2fG4X9WzxVo.mp4,So would you feel supported by Mental Health Services and if you still felt that you needed that support and to deal with your mental health today.
4113,2fG4X9WzxVo.mp4,"Yeah, you know who you are."
4114,2fG4X9WzxVo.mp4,I would definitely feel supported.
4115,2fG4X9WzxVo.mp4,I mean before coronavirus all happened.
4116,2fG4X9WzxVo.mp4,I was actually discharged from the perinatal Mental Health Service.
4117,2fG4X9WzxVo.mp4,And obviously it was a mutual decision.
4118,2fG4X9WzxVo.mp4,"I felt like, you know, I've come a long way."
4119,2fG4X9WzxVo.mp4,I was ready to sort of go off on my own but I was never alone because they need made clear to me that if ever I felt that I was you know in need of any kind of support.
4120,2fG4X9WzxVo.mp4,I felt my anxiety coming back.
4121,2fG4X9WzxVo.mp4,I was feeling like I needed that.
4122,2fG4X9WzxVo.mp4,"Again, they will literally phone call away."
4123,2fG4X9WzxVo.mp4,"And I think that reassurance has been solved beneficial as well in getting me through these past few months during cut covid-19 as well to know that if ever, you know, things were starting to feel like I was feeling unwell again, I have got that support networking place."
4124,xrdOjQi4FB0.mp4,We're looking at a live shot of the White House Tonight the seed of executive power in the United States.
4125,xrdOjQi4FB0.mp4,"But on this evening, the US president is elsewhere in the capital being treated for covid-19 at the Walter Reed Army Medical Center."
4126,xrdOjQi4FB0.mp4,We want to get a better sense of what could lie ahead for him.
4127,xrdOjQi4FB0.mp4,"Dr. Ali ex-con joins us now from Omaha, Nebraska former assistant US Surgeon General and currently at Dean at the College of Public Health at the University of Nebraska Medical Center."
4128,xrdOjQi4FB0.mp4,"Dr. Khan, of course, we're notAsk you to diagnose the president from afar but based on your expertise."
4129,xrdOjQi4FB0.mp4,"I want you to reflect on this yesterday the president test positive and then in quick succession, he shows symptoms."
4130,xrdOjQi4FB0.mp4,"He's now in hospital does the speed with which this is moving concern you Potentially, but again, we don't have all the details by the way good evening."
4131,xrdOjQi4FB0.mp4,Thank you for the opportunity potentially.
4132,xrdOjQi4FB0.mp4,But let's be honest.
4133,xrdOjQi4FB0.mp4,We don't really have all the facts some of the additional data suggest that the president actually was sick before he even took the test.
4134,xrdOjQi4FB0.mp4,"So, yes, correct."
4135,xrdOjQi4FB0.mp4,"If you're most people if you're testing them every day, you would find them to be positive probably two days before they have symptoms, but he may well have had symptoms by the time he was tested this time."
4136,xrdOjQi4FB0.mp4,What about the notion of moving the president to Walter Reed to be in hospital as opposed to watchful waiting in the White House does that in and of itself raised alarms?
4137,xrdOjQi4FB0.mp4,Not at all and it's a very prudent decision to make sure that the page that the president is being watched by some of the best clinicians in the United States at the current time.
4138,xrdOjQi4FB0.mp4,We know the president age 74 years old.
4139,xrdOjQi4FB0.mp4,He is considered technically at least to be obese that from his mother.
4140,xrdOjQi4FB0.mp4,Recent White House physical.
4141,xrdOjQi4FB0.mp4,"So those two things are known to make covid symptoms worse, but on the other hand not a smoker not a drinker."
4142,xrdOjQi4FB0.mp4,How would you assess his risk factors?
4143,xrdOjQi4FB0.mp4,And he's also and he's also a man and men tend to do worse than women with this disease.
4144,xrdOjQi4FB0.mp4,"So he actually has the worst risk factor number one, which is age."
4145,xrdOjQi4FB0.mp4,So 80 percent of the deaths that we've seen in the United States or people greater than 65 years of age.
4146,xrdOjQi4FB0.mp4,So his risk is a absolute risk.
4147,xrdOjQi4FB0.mp4,Hopefully he will do well he were all praying for him.
4148,xrdOjQi4FB0.mp4,And the first lady to do very well.
4149,xrdOjQi4FB0.mp4,So is absolute risk is probably 50 to a hundred times more than somebody else given his wrist fact given his risk factors relative risk is higher but is absolute risk still is very low remember in the United States.
4150,xrdOjQi4FB0.mp4,"We are dropping number of people who died down to about 1% and we have about 30 seconds left, but you know, we heard somebody say A little earlier a political analyst her experience was she felt a lot sicker in the second week than she did in the first week when she had covid would we expect to see that kind of pattern for the president as well?"
4151,xrdOjQi4FB0.mp4,That's a typical pattern and that's not the pattern we want to see so we would like to see people sort of resolve.
4152,xrdOjQi4FB0.mp4,They are viral infection in the first week and not go on into the second week when they may well have this aberrant immune response that causes the cytokine storm and a more severe illness.
4153,xrdOjQi4FB0.mp4,So we hope that the president will resolve this very quickly.
4154,xrdOjQi4FB0.mp4,"I really appreciate your perspective today Doctor Ali asked on joining us from Omaha, Nebraska."
4155,GLAkF_T9Xgc.mp4,A terrible thing to have coronavirus.
4156,GLAkF_T9Xgc.mp4,Were you sitting there at home and all seriousness?
4157,GLAkF_T9Xgc.mp4,Were you sitting at home going?
4158,GLAkF_T9Xgc.mp4,Oh my God.
4159,GLAkF_T9Xgc.mp4,I'm going to die.
4160,GLAkF_T9Xgc.mp4,Did you feel good?
4161,GLAkF_T9Xgc.mp4,"Because you know, everyone is soon so, you know what I had the symptoms that that you read about which is fever tight chest a key."
4162,GLAkF_T9Xgc.mp4,No sense of smell cough the thick I'm asthmatic.
4163,GLAkF_T9Xgc.mp4,So I was the Long's are the thing that that that are what you should monitor.
4164,GLAkF_T9Xgc.mp4,"Monitor and be concerned about my doctors advised me early on to get something called a pulse pulse oximeter, which is something you can get at the drugstore and it's just this little device that you stick your finger in that takes your pulse."
4165,GLAkF_T9Xgc.mp4,But it also measures how much oxygen your lungs are getting and he gave me a reading and he said if it goes below this number call me so I kind of knew that then I mean I was I would stick in.
4166,GLAkF_T9Xgc.mp4,Finger in this thing all day long.
4167,GLAkF_T9Xgc.mp4,Just making sure that it was okay.
4168,GLAkF_T9Xgc.mp4,And that is what kept me calm.
4169,GLAkF_T9Xgc.mp4,Do you have any clue how you got it?
4170,GLAkF_T9Xgc.mp4,I mean were you I mean I have this image of you is like carrying on with everybody and socializing and talking and going you know what I'm not going to get the fucking coronavirus or something like that.
4171,GLAkF_T9Xgc.mp4,Yeah.
4172,GLAkF_T9Xgc.mp4,You got it.
4173,GLAkF_T9Xgc.mp4,I don't know.
4174,GLAkF_T9Xgc.mp4,I mean they could have I mean I hate to say it but it could have been anybody it was that we it was the week.
4175,GLAkF_T9Xgc.mp4,I think my first symptoms started around the 16th or so of March.
4176,GLAkF_T9Xgc.mp4,So it was that week before that.
4177,GLAkF_T9Xgc.mp4,I was still doing Watch What Happens Live?
4178,GLAkF_T9Xgc.mp4,I was that serious.
4179,GLAkF_T9Xgc.mp4,I was I was on stage at 54 Below one night.
4180,GLAkF_T9Xgc.mp4,"I mean, I was all over the place that we what did you do with your son when you know, you have coronavirus."
4181,GLAkF_T9Xgc.mp4,You can't expect me to stay away from him for I've stayed away from him for I think it was 13 days total I saw Yesterday for the first time right now.
4182,GLAkF_T9Xgc.mp4,I think that it's important that if you get it and you start having these symptoms you have to say Okay.
4183,GLAkF_T9Xgc.mp4,Well the odds are with me.
4184,GLAkF_T9Xgc.mp4,That's what I felt.
4185,GLAkF_T9Xgc.mp4,I knew immediately.
4186,GLAkF_T9Xgc.mp4,I knew I had to self quarantine from my son which was the most important thing and that I had to start taking Tylenol and drinking a lot of fluids and monitor myself on this little pulse oximeter.
4187,GLAkF_T9Xgc.mp4,So that's the thing that I think that you can't Panic if ATP if the odds are that 80% of you are going to get it in a case.
4188,GLAkF_T9Xgc.mp4,Like I had then you have to just let it work through your system.
4189,67HvhHFU4i4.mp4,This outbreak is by no means an anomaly infectious diseases emerge and re-emerge more quickly than ever before killing hundreds of thousands of people decimating local economies and triggering panic around the world our Health Care Systems at home and abroad are frightening leave vulnerable to disease outbreaks of all kinds.The fact is Life as we know it will no longer exist physical distancing and mask-wearing in public are our norms for the foreseeable future essentially our ecosystem of welcoming and meeting each other has been completely uprooted.
4190,67HvhHFU4i4.mp4,As I watched the national news as I read multiple papers and journals.
4191,67HvhHFU4i4.mp4,I am also in awe of the collective optimism and determination that we will get through this and I am hopeful that we will but all of us in public health know the only way forward is through science research effective communication and a greater understanding of how truly it interdependent and how fragile we all are.
4192,67HvhHFU4i4.mp4,public Health's time is now
4193,ltYvcxYpiPw.mp4,"Hello, I'm one Davis Chief creative officer at Casey TN PBS SoCal and I'm joined by The Newsroom of KPCC and La is on a Daily Reporter Roundup."
4194,ltYvcxYpiPw.mp4,How is everyone?
4195,ltYvcxYpiPw.mp4,"Well, thank you Jackie."
4196,ltYvcxYpiPw.mp4,You've been following the latest from Health officials.
4197,ltYvcxYpiPw.mp4,Where do things stand today Health officials have been warning us for weeks that as more people are tested for covid-19.
4198,ltYvcxYpiPw.mp4,We're going to see more cases and deaths to beBit that's exactly what we're seeing today.
4199,ltYvcxYpiPw.mp4,The LA County Health Department announced that nine more people have died due to the virus and there are hundreds more cases just from yesterday.
4200,ltYvcxYpiPw.mp4,"So now there are more than 1,200 known coronavirus cases in LA county officials are preparing for a surgeon patients."
4201,ltYvcxYpiPw.mp4,The LA County Convention Center is being prepped to take in covid-19 patients who need to stay isolated after they're discharged from the hospital.
4202,ltYvcxYpiPw.mp4,We're also trying to understand how How well the system is set up for really a worst-case scenario and that's what Sharon's been working on for us.
4203,ltYvcxYpiPw.mp4,One of the really hard things about a pandemic is additional deaths can overwhelm our system to deal with human remains state and local governments have been working with the funeral industry to come up with a plan for all that.
4204,ltYvcxYpiPw.mp4,They figure pandemic in our area could crowd six months worth of work for a typical Mortuary into just six or eight weeks.
4205,ltYvcxYpiPw.mp4,"So private funeral homes with still handle most of the bodies the big local Cemetery says, it's Mausoleum has extra space to store remains if they run out of space that County coroner is prepared to step in with refrigerated storage to help out."
4206,ltYvcxYpiPw.mp4,"But as the pandemic peaks in our area, we could be facing problems, like delays and families getting the death certificates that they need."
4207,ltYvcxYpiPw.mp4,Another thing.
4208,ltYvcxYpiPw.mp4,We're looking at in The Newsroom or paying a lot of attention to is how the pandemic is impacting the most vulnerable populations the match no clothes also been looking at how those who are unhappy housed are experiencing this he's so obviously homeless people are exceptionally vulnerable and there are efforts to get a lot of people inside with the reality is it's a lot of people who are outside right now or just going to have to stay there and ride this out outside where they are on the efforts though to bring people in LA City and LA County are working to expand the low-barrier homeless shelter system specifically using recreation centers and other public buildings.
4209,ltYvcxYpiPw.mp4,What's new today though is we're not talking about setting up sort of safe camping zones around those Recreation.
4210,ltYvcxYpiPw.mp4,"In public parks, since those rec centers will come with access to food water and cleaning facilities."
4211,ltYvcxYpiPw.mp4,All of those things food water especially are really in desperate need given everything else to shut down in a lot of the places for people to access food has gone away.
4212,ltYvcxYpiPw.mp4,"We also have about 5,000 hotel rooms that have been located in LA county that could be used to isolate anybody who's homeless and is showing symptoms or tests positive for covid-19."
4213,ltYvcxYpiPw.mp4,And one of the other focus is in our Newsroom is really education.
4214,ltYvcxYpiPw.mp4,"We have four reporters right now focus on education, Mariana has been looking at That 0 to 5 age and how this is affecting those kids and also their parents just as we've seen public K-12 schools closed."
4215,ltYvcxYpiPw.mp4,We are now seeing daycare centers and preschools around the state closing.
4216,ltYvcxYpiPw.mp4,There is no mandate that they have to close a rather.
4217,ltYvcxYpiPw.mp4,They are voluntarily closing because of concern that they might participate in spreading coronavirus because little kids really don't social distance very well in other cases parents are being sent home and because there's no income coming in or because there About their kids safety.
4218,ltYvcxYpiPw.mp4,They are pulling their kids out of the daycare programs.
4219,ltYvcxYpiPw.mp4,Meanwhile early educators are trying to figure out how to set up their virtual classrooms.
4220,ltYvcxYpiPw.mp4,But there's some challenges there.
4221,ltYvcxYpiPw.mp4,I talked to one LAUSD transitional kindergarten teacher West meets 80% of her kids don't have access to the internet right now.
4222,ltYvcxYpiPw.mp4,"And on top of that a lot of child's brain development is really tied to in-person interaction, which you just can't replicate online."
4223,ltYvcxYpiPw.mp4,So what tips can you give to those of us at home?
4224,ltYvcxYpiPw.mp4,With kids.
4225,ltYvcxYpiPw.mp4,"Well, I would say set your expectations reasonably."
4226,ltYvcxYpiPw.mp4,If you weren't already homeschooling don't expect that you're going to be an expert anytime soon.
4227,ltYvcxYpiPw.mp4,"And if you're finding stuff burdensome or stressful, it's okay to kind of relax if setting up Zoom with your kids teacher is too stressful."
4228,ltYvcxYpiPw.mp4,"Just don't do it start simple set up a regular routine, even if sleeping in it's a part of it."
4229,ltYvcxYpiPw.mp4,That's okay.
4230,ltYvcxYpiPw.mp4,And then for very young children one of the most important things is for toddlers to really feel like they're in a safe.
4231,ltYvcxYpiPw.mp4,"Stable environment, so if you communicate with them calmly they're more likely to be calm to over at our house or making cookies get through the pandemic with oatmeal chocolate chip cookies."
4232,ltYvcxYpiPw.mp4,"Well, thanks so much to all of you from the KPCC nlas Newsroom and thank you for tuning in B save take care of your family and we'll see you tomorrow."
4233,_stetUkxxjM.mp4,Firstly what is contact tracing.
4234,_stetUkxxjM.mp4,"Well, very simply put its the process of us identifying and getting in contact with people that we think are at risk of getting a particular disease in this case covid-19."
4235,_stetUkxxjM.mp4,We give them information and advice and we asked them to take certain measures to help prevent the onward transmission of the disease.
4236,_stetUkxxjM.mp4,Should they become symptomatic?
4237,_stetUkxxjM.mp4,"Let's imagine a population in which one person has covid-19 that person of course comes into contact with others and then we have two people who catch the disease now we have Infectious people who spread the disease each to another two people and as you can see very quickly the disease spreads and in this case with just three generations of transmission one infected person translates into 26 infected people and by the tenth generation, this would be over 21,000 people."
4238,_stetUkxxjM.mp4,"Now, let's look at the same three generations of transmission, but here where people are coming into contact with each other far less often because of restrictions on movement."
4239,_stetUkxxjM.mp4,"Of course, these kinds of restrictions can have a devastating effect on people's lives and on the economy and governments don't take these restrictions lately, but they can't lift the restrictions until they should that mechanisms are in place that will prevent and at least mitigate any risk of a second wave of the outbreak hitting the population and that's the value of contact tracing."
4240,_stetUkxxjM.mp4,"Now, the point of contact tracing is that we can create that same physical distance, but specifically between people Where there is an opportunity to break the chain of transmission, let me show you how that works."
4241,_stetUkxxjM.mp4,When a person is diagnosed with covid-19.
4242,_stetUkxxjM.mp4,We identify the people that have been exposed to that person and may be at risk of developing the disease and we ask those people to restrict their movements and to create physical distance from others.
4243,_stetUkxxjM.mp4,"And in this example, let's imagine that three of the people that were in contact with him develop covid-19 because of the physical distance in created by the contact tracing program."
4244,_stetUkxxjM.mp4,Those people have not put anybody else at risk and the chain of transmission.
4245,_stetUkxxjM.mp4,Can be broken those people will have court recover and return to their normal lives.
4246,_stetUkxxjM.mp4,Almost all people that have recovered on a longer susceptible.
4247,_stetUkxxjM.mp4,In other words.
4248,_stetUkxxjM.mp4,They've got an element of immunity.
4249,_stetUkxxjM.mp4,And so the return of previously ill people back to society starts to create what we call epidemiological distance between susceptible people a kind of epidemiological firewall you could say and this of course also contributes to the slowing down of transmission in the community.
4250,_stetUkxxjM.mp4,I hope you found that useful.
4251,_stetUkxxjM.mp4,"I have some other videos that you might like, there'll be links in the description below for example a video Oh that I put together in 2018 in which I highlight the risks of zoonotic outbreaks with pandemic potential."
4252,_stetUkxxjM.mp4,I've also got videos on outbreak control and things like how to create and how to interpret epidemic curves.
4253,_stetUkxxjM.mp4,Thanks for watching.
4254,_stetUkxxjM.mp4,Stay safe.
4255,RN81h85V6D4.mp4,Covid-19 is the short name for the disease known as novel coronavirus disease 2019 coronavirus has are a large group of similar viruses.
4256,RN81h85V6D4.mp4,Some are known to infect humans such as SARS Covey and MERS Covey.
4257,RN81h85V6D4.mp4,The one that causes covid-19 is called SARS Covey to all coronavirus has are named for the crown like spikes that cover their surface called Spike or sProteins inside the virus genetic material called RNA is made up of genes genes carry the information to make more copies of the virus the virus can infect you if it enters your mouth nose or lungs.
4258,RN81h85V6D4.mp4,Inside your body the S protein of the virus locks to a receptor on the surface of one of your cells.
4259,RN81h85V6D4.mp4,This can trigger the virus to enter the cell in a couple of ways it may cause the virus to fuse with the cell surface.
4260,RN81h85V6D4.mp4,Then release its genes into the cell.
4261,RN81h85V6D4.mp4,Or the cell may pull the virus inside by enclosing it in a sack once inside the virus confused to the sack and release its genes.
4262,RN81h85V6D4.mp4,Next the genes use a structure in your cell called a ribosome to make new copies of the virus.
4263,RN81h85V6D4.mp4,The new virus has traveled to the surface of the cell.
4264,RN81h85V6D4.mp4,There they leave to infect more cells in the meantime viral s proteins left on the surface of the infected cell can cause it to fuse with nearby healthy cells forming a giant cell.
4265,RN81h85V6D4.mp4,This may be another way for the virus to spread between cells people may be infected with covid-19 for 2 to 14 days before symptoms appear.
4266,RN81h85V6D4.mp4,The three main symptoms of covid-19 are a fever cough and shortness of breath.
4267,RN81h85V6D4.mp4,"Other symptoms may include tiredness body aches stuffy nose, sore throat diarrhea and vomiting loss of appetite and loss of smell."
4268,RN81h85V6D4.mp4,Most people have a mild illness and can recover at home.
4269,RN81h85V6D4.mp4,Some people who have the virus may not get sick at all or may show no symptoms.
4270,RN81h85V6D4.mp4,But if you have trouble breathing or any other symptoms that are severe call your doctor or the emergency room.
4271,RN81h85V6D4.mp4,They will tell you what to do.
4272,RN81h85V6D4.mp4,"for most people who have the virus the risk for serious illness is thought to be low people 65 years and older may have a higher risk for serious illness and people of any age may be at high risk if they have underlying conditions such as chronic lung disease or asthma serious heart conditions diabetes severe obesity chronic, kidney disease and liver disease High risk groups also include people with a weakened immune system including those on certain medications such as corticosteroids people in cancer treatment and those with HIV or Aids."
4273,RN81h85V6D4.mp4,"Even if you aren't in a high-risk group, it's important to practice social distancing which means keeping at least two meters or 6 feet between you and other people this helps prevent infections and serious illness in others as well as yourself."
4274,RN81h85V6D4.mp4,For up-to-date information about covid-19 and other ways to prevent its spread visit the CDC website at cdc.gov.

4278,UoDyLwSxFis.mp4,You can call me a crazy cool coconut shop.
4279,UoDyLwSxFis.mp4,I don't care prepper is what I am.
4280,UoDyLwSxFis.mp4,I am preparing for disaster.
4281,UoDyLwSxFis.mp4,This is scary.
4282,UoDyLwSxFis.mp4,"I mean, it's touchy scary sensitive subject matter, but it is absolute method necessity to talk about it members from the prepper community at times."
4283,UoDyLwSxFis.mp4,Trade as overzealous or even paranoid offer their Insight on disaster preparedness in light of the Coronavirus.
4284,UoDyLwSxFis.mp4,I've been following this virus since what December right when I first heard about it when I first infected 25 people.
4285,UoDyLwSxFis.mp4,"I had already had and 95 mask microbial wife's hand sanitizer because that's one of the things you do when you start prepping International spaces are now growing fear for certain people and you when you look at New York City for an example, you're talking about an international City one of the greatest things that we can do it mean, this is Classic."
4286,UoDyLwSxFis.mp4,This is from Grandmother.

4290,UoDyLwSxFis.mp4,Don't go on a Mad Dash for food and water you go to the store today pick up an extra thing of water and a couple more kids and do that for the next couple of weeks until you you feel comfortable with what you have in your home.
4291,UoDyLwSxFis.mp4,"Okay, so if you have to lock in quarantine in your house, House, you know for 30 days or two weeks make sure that you are set you have four people in your house."
4292,UoDyLwSxFis.mp4,Each person technically should be drinking a gallon of water.
4293,UoDyLwSxFis.mp4,Don't forget cooking and hygiene washing.
4294,UoDyLwSxFis.mp4,So 30 days do the math.
4295,UoDyLwSxFis.mp4,I wouldn't be like I told you so you should have been doing this because it like I said before it doesn't help anyone and I wouldn't even call it prepping.
4296,UoDyLwSxFis.mp4,I think it's just being responsible.

4309,xYjicqjVbbg.mp4,What kind of questions do you ask when you enter clients location and that makes our life a lot easier.
4310,xYjicqjVbbg.mp4,We just have to use different precautions building with covid-19 and we should be okay.
4311,xYjicqjVbbg.mp4,Domo how about we are the only resource that they have to the outside world sometimes.
4312,xYjicqjVbbg.mp4,Idina bar You don't know.
4313,xYjicqjVbbg.mp4,We have to be like a trooper to go up here for them.
4314,Qh1vq66ZqPw.mp4,"Well, Alan Glenda we know at this point schools are already re-evaluating and in some cases outright canceling their study abroad programs, but now there's question over whether they're going to take the big bold step to move their classes completely online."
4315,Qh1vq66ZqPw.mp4,We have a student who out of an abundance of caution is being tested after reporting flu-like symptoms in a YouTube video address Hope College president Matthew skogen alerting the public to the School's First Student in quarantine.Teen after potential exposure to the covid-19 virus just the latest in a string of students and faculty finding themselves in isolation at Eastern Michigan University officials.
4316,Qh1vq66ZqPw.mp4,Say 33 students and two faculty members are in self quarantine until March 15th after returning back from to school related trips to Italy earlier this month elsewhere at Oakland Community College students in a French class receiving a surprising message from their instructor over the weekend.
4317,Qh1vq66ZqPw.mp4,This is an announcement class will be conducted online for the next two weeks.
4318,Qh1vq66ZqPw.mp4,OCC students are Anu and says her professor had concerns after returning from a trip to France but despite the developments today.
4319,Qh1vq66ZqPw.mp4,It's business as usual at Hope College.
4320,Qh1vq66ZqPw.mp4,That means classes are in session Michigan University's telling us they are operating at full capacity amidst news of other colleges across the country including Harvard Stanford and Ohio State beginning to take dramatic.
4321,Qh1vq66ZqPw.mp4,UPS to ensure safety by moving their classes completely online but local schools from emu to Michigan State to Auckland University.
4322,Qh1vq66ZqPw.mp4,Tell 7 Action News.
4323,Qh1vq66ZqPw.mp4,They have a team monitoring the fluid situation and that they are actively planning for online classes if needed something students tell me they would welcome.
4324,Qh1vq66ZqPw.mp4,I think it's better for everybody because it's a matter of safety in the meantime until we can really get a handle on it.
4325,Qh1vq66ZqPw.mp4,That's probably the safest decision.
4326,Qh1vq66ZqPw.mp4,And some schools have even asked their students to notify them when International visitors plan to be on campus anytime in the next three months.
4327,Qh1vq66ZqPw.mp4,So we are starting to see more stringent measures in place that said all the colleges and universities.
4328,Qh1vq66ZqPw.mp4,I spoke to said today that until we have a confirmed case of coronavirus in the state of Michigan.
4329,Qh1vq66ZqPw.mp4,They don't plan to make any determination on moving those classes online.
4330,Qh1vq66ZqPw.mp4,We'll have to wait and see for now.

4332,PrJK6vPwg38.mp4,Hi everyone.
4333,PrJK6vPwg38.mp4,My name is Eleanor car me and I'm a researcher at Liverpool University in the UK and I'm working on two main projects that are related to the info genealogy topic.
4334,PrJK6vPwg38.mp4,One of them is developing citizens that literacies and the other one is the politics of platforms design and one of the things that I liked about the most in the First World Health Organization conference about info demonology was the fact that so many people from different disciplines came to the table and brought their knowledge and different kind of methods and ways of thinking in order toYou think about a creative way to solve or sir to tackle this issue?
4335,PrJK6vPwg38.mp4,And I think one of the most interesting discussions that we have is that the sort of see this in a larger and broader context and realize that a lot of other organizations are involved with this issue.
4336,PrJK6vPwg38.mp4,"So for example, we talked about the responsibilities of the platform's we talked about responsibility of journalists and also politicians and I think that moving forward we need to enable citizens to develop critical ways of thinking but also engaging in the online environment because after we solve this current pandemic we might experience other in the future."
4337,PrJK6vPwg38.mp4,So we need to develop a sustainable infrastructure or citizens are able to understand the kind of different online environments that they engage with to understand different kind of communities of trust and to be able to understand what they are seeing and to critically evaluate that
4338,Wc3vAd-e-H8.mp4,There's a lot of discussion if kids contribute to the spread of covid-19 the authors of the following paper take an interesting approach to the problem.
4339,Wc3vAd-e-H8.mp4,"The author is trying to estimate the number of hospitalized pediatric covid-19 infections in Wuhan prior to the lockdown of January 23rd, a retrospective review found that there were six children with confirmed covid-19 who are hospitalized in the period between January 7 to January 15 in all districts of Wuhan This was before the lockdown occurred during that same time."
4340,Wc3vAd-e-H8.mp4,There were 43 pediatric cases of influenza who are also hospitalized in those same hospitals.
4341,Wc3vAd-e-H8.mp4,The author's use that ratio between covid-19 and influenza patients to gauge the true prevalence of covid-19 in the region before lockdown.
4342,Wc3vAd-e-H8.mp4,Here's how they did it.
4343,Wc3vAd-e-H8.mp4,They used influenza surveillance data to estimate the number of influenza cases in the entire region during the That nine-day period based on the age specific ratio between covid-19 and influenza cases.
4344,Wc3vAd-e-H8.mp4,They estimated the prevalence of covid-19 among the Pediatric population for the various districts of Wuhan.
4345,Wc3vAd-e-H8.mp4,According to their estimates there could have been 313 cases of covid-19 throughout Wuhan during this nine-day period under an epidemic doubling time of 7.31 days.
4346,Wc3vAd-e-H8.mp4,"They estimated that there could have been as many as 1105 pediatric covid-19 hospitalizations prior to January 23rd the day when lockdown of Wuhan occurred this far surpasses, the 425 confirmed reported cases across all age groups of that day."
4347,Wc3vAd-e-H8.mp4,"None of which were children under age 15 in various Publications infections in children under 10 years of age accounted for Just Around 1% of all infections, according to this trial we might be missing something kids do get sick."
4348,Wc3vAd-e-H8.mp4,We know that the rate at which they get infected could be much larger than we Think kids could have a much higher incidence of asymptomatic disease their symptoms could be different from what we would expect from our experience in the grown-up population.
4349,Wc3vAd-e-H8.mp4,"Now, what are the implications if they do get infected then closing schools is definitely a good idea similarly."
4350,Wc3vAd-e-H8.mp4,If they do get infected then they will contribute to the number of cases due to their low mortality rate though.
4351,Wc3vAd-e-H8.mp4,They won't contribute to the the number of deaths which will make the overall case fatality rate associated with covid-19 much lower.
4352,Wc3vAd-e-H8.mp4,This would be a good thing.
4353,Wc3vAd-e-H8.mp4,"Another good thing if they become infected, they will also develop immunity thereby contributing to a herd immunity higher herd immunity will also cause the effect of reproductive ratio to go down which will ultimately stop the pandemic."
4354,Wc3vAd-e-H8.mp4,This is the age distribution of the United States of America as of 2019 the age group of children below 10 years makes up around six percent of the American population this Could contribute some however not a whole lot to herd immunity.
4355,Wc3vAd-e-H8.mp4,"But if we take the age group of all kids and teens below 20 years, they make up around 12% of the population."
4356,Wc3vAd-e-H8.mp4,This group doesn't get very sick when infected their immunity.
4357,Wc3vAd-e-H8.mp4,However could significantly help to get a handle on the pandemic.
4358,Wc3vAd-e-H8.mp4,This is especially true for countries with a higher proportion of children as is the case in many developing countries.
4359,Wc3vAd-e-H8.mp4,Please note that we've just recently opened up our entire library of courses to hospitals that are taking care of covid-19 patients.
4360,Wc3vAd-e-H8.mp4,"So if you want to learn mechanical ventilation and other important ICU skills, please make sure to set up your institution with a free group subscription."
4361,6n9ZsHSc4YA.mp4,"That's the covid-19 outbreak in Singapore drags on authorities have decided to use a mobile app to help with the arduous task of finding clothes context of infected persons, and they want you to play your part."
4362,6n9ZsHSc4YA.mp4,So it's pretty simple to download this app find Trace together from the app store or Google Play Store.
4363,6n9ZsHSc4YA.mp4,Enter your number key in the one-time password and consent to your mobile number being stored in a secured registry then ensure Bluetooth and push notifications are switched on.
4364,6n9ZsHSc4YA.mp4,IPhone users also need to keep the app running for it to work.
4365,6n9ZsHSc4YA.mp4,Now how the app works is that it first attaches a random ID to your mobile number in then uses Bluetooth to detect other users who come within two to five meters of you and Records during the Midas internally.
4366,6n9ZsHSc4YA.mp4,"Now, if for instance I have tested positive for covid-19, mlh will contact me with a code for me to send my a blocks over they will then be able to decrypt the random IDs to in the mobile numbers of my close contacts Now this really helps as I don't have to rely on my memory to figure out who I've met over the course of the past few weeks."
4367,6n9ZsHSc4YA.mp4,"This also makes the process faster and more accurate now authorities have inserted multiple measures to protect users privacy and personal data for status usage of this app is voluntary and there are no plans to make it mandatory most importantly the app only collects your mobile number and nothing else not even your name and location data furthermore, moh is the Only Authority that will be able to decrypt the random IDs and match them to specific mobile numbers."
4368,6n9ZsHSc4YA.mp4,"Now, you might ask what's in it for you."
4369,6n9ZsHSc4YA.mp4,Well for it is have said that the app will help protect yourself because authorities will be able to contact you quicker.
4370,6n9ZsHSc4YA.mp4,If you have been in close contact with an infected person.
4371,6n9ZsHSc4YA.mp4,It also helps protect your loved ones and the community because it will help minimize the spread of the virus and make things easier for contact tracers.
4372,3TtHg5XgZzI.mp4,Covid-19 is changed a lot of things but you and your family still have to eat going to the grocery store.
4373,3TtHg5XgZzI.mp4,Here are some tips first check the status of the store.
4374,3TtHg5XgZzI.mp4,Is it open for Shoppers for pickup or for home?
4375,3TtHg5XgZzI.mp4,"Delivery only also stores might have special shopping hours for seniors and those with help challenges if you go make a shopping list in advance, so you don't spend more time in the store than you need to this will help protect both you and the grocery store."
4376,3TtHg5XgZzI.mp4,Staff by just one to two weeks worth of groceries at a time.
4377,3TtHg5XgZzI.mp4,Where a face covering our mask while you're in the store observe the six feet rule take your own wipes or use the ones Supply by the store to wipe down the handles of the shopping cart or basket using reusable shopping bags.
4378,3TtHg5XgZzI.mp4,Make sure reusable shopping bags are cleaned or washed regularly home from the store wash those hands right away.
4379,3TtHg5XgZzI.mp4,"And after you put away your groceries, there's no So food or food packaging spreading covid-19."
4380,3TtHg5XgZzI.mp4,"However, if you wish you can wipe down your groceries and let them air dry as an extra precaution and always follow these tips for storing and preparing food at home clean separate cook and chill rinse fresh fruits and vegetables under running tap water fridge rate and freeze things that can go bad within two hours of buying and a good idea to check these temps wipe down kitchen counters and other high touch."

4383,YArNt8SoK9o.mp4,That's breaking news.
4384,YArNt8SoK9o.mp4,Just coming in the IPM on how to shoot fresh guidelines for traffic and teaching desk.
4385,YArNt8SoK9o.mp4,"It has gone head and recommended one specific type of test, especially for the continuing zones in the healthcare settings guidelines are now mentioned that the death comes negative."
4386,YArNt8SoK9o.mp4,Then RG PCR test will be done.
4387,YArNt8SoK9o.mp4,If it comes positive.
4388,YArNt8SoK9o.mp4,It should be considered as quote unquote true positive and no rt-pcr test is required in that particular case for Mark Martin are breaking the story.
4389,YArNt8SoK9o.mp4,Orie is now joining us for the very latest Kumar just for our viewers the rapid antigen test means the antibody testing and correct me.
4390,YArNt8SoK9o.mp4,"If I'm wrong there now fresh set of guidelines have been issued for this and recommended one specific kind of tests, especially for the containment zones."
4391,YArNt8SoK9o.mp4,And for the healthcare setting that you could walk our viewers through what this distinction is.
4392,YArNt8SoK9o.mp4,"Please at the time when the number of tests is really a matter of concern and government want to increase the number of test this kind of this guideline for my CMR can help government in increasing the number of tests, especially in the containment Jones and at high risk medical facilities Zone where many of the persons are found to be symptomatic."
4393,YArNt8SoK9o.mp4,"So this session lines from guidelines from icmr is clearly telling that all those who are symptomatic they can go through this antibody test and Rapid test and if the result is positive, then it can be dealt as a true positive means then the person will be considered as covid positive, but in case it if it comes as negative then the alternate Rt-pcr test which is happening right now at various places will take place on that person and the then for just to check cross check the reliability that testing will be done."
4394,YArNt8SoK9o.mp4,"What icmr is also telling that they have done did it through various research the research proposals and they concluded that it is accurate up to 84% So This new kit is accurate up to 84% So some group of increasing number of tests in India, especially in containment anomaly right as India battles covid Canal command."
4395,YArNt8SoK9o.mp4,Canal gets us the latest when it comes to I see Mrs.
4396,YArNt8SoK9o.mp4,Guidelines when it comes to Rapid antigen test as well moving on.

4625,1HLMyijbn_E.mp4,So let's be physically distant but socially close because we're in this together.
4626,1HLMyijbn_E.mp4,That's what science tastes like.
4627,5fGIT1pwcbE.mp4,In December 2019 a new respiratory illness known as covid-19 caused by a novel coronavirus was first detected in the central Chinese city of Wuhan within the first five weeks of the outbreak tens of thousands of people were infected in more than a thousand died.
4628,5fGIT1pwcbE.mp4,"The outbreak has been categorized as a public health emergency by the World Health Organization, not surprisingly."
4629,5fGIT1pwcbE.mp4,"The virus is having economic impacts throughout the world major companies, like apple Starbucks and McDonald's close."

4631,5fGIT1pwcbE.mp4,"However, the US Stock Market seemed to quickly recover hitting new all-time highs on February 12th, even as the virus continues to spread it's not clear how much the virus will impact us investors, but the effects could go deeper than just retail and travel hitting."
4632,5fGIT1pwcbE.mp4,"And industries, you might not expect like energy automotive and banking taking a look at these potential impacts can help you prepare your portfolio for possible Market turbulence as the world's biggest importer of oil China is a major player in the energy sector the Lunar New Year typically leads to an increase in demand of jet fuel and gasoline instead demand for oil and China dropped 20% in the weeks immediately after the outbreak in the price of crude oil dropped about 16 percent between the outbreak in early."
4633,5fGIT1pwcbE.mp4,February this is putting some strain on American oil companies.
4634,5fGIT1pwcbE.mp4,China doesn't buy much oil from American exporters roughly two percent of exports but oil prices are set on a global level.
4635,5fGIT1pwcbE.mp4,So lower prices means lower profits companies like Exxon Mobil and Chevron saw share prices drop in the first six weeks of 2020 at least one firm is downgraded its outlook on oil from bullish to neutral and it says a further downgrade maybe in the future while a number of factors impact oil prices like In global politics lower demand driven by the coronavirus could increase pressure on the energy sector.
4636,5fGIT1pwcbE.mp4,The coronavirus is also slowing down many automakers dozens of car makers across the world work with Chinese suppliers to produce parts for their vehicles.
4637,5fGIT1pwcbE.mp4,But many of those shops have closed as part of mandatory quarantines.
4638,5fGIT1pwcbE.mp4,This could result in some plant closures.
4639,5fGIT1pwcbE.mp4,"For example, fiat-chrysler is warned that some European plants May close if the interruption to its supply chain continues in addition to supply chain disruptions, It's automakers may also face decreased demand one analyst told the financial times that China faces a traumatic next few months suggesting people might even delay buying cars the high level of exposure to Chinese suppliers and consumers could add risked Automotive Securities while there may be several factors at play many major manufacturers have seen steep declines in share prices since the outbreak became widely reported banking is another industry that's facing uncertainty with the coronavirus in recent."

4681,TdIsTLg7RQM.mp4,Right.
4682,TdIsTLg7RQM.mp4,Now the majority of tests being used to diagnose covid-19 are genetic test known as PCR tests.
4683,TdIsTLg7RQM.mp4,"These tests are very accurate because even if there's only a tiny amount of virus present in the patient sample, PCR which stands for polymerase chain reaction is able to take genetic material from the virus Target specific Gene segments that only the virus has and make a very large number of copies of those segments so that they can be detected and measured using this method a PCR test can tell you if you have covid-19 right now, but not if you've had it in the past."
4684,TdIsTLg7RQM.mp4,Although this type of test usually delivers results in 4 to 6 hours.
4685,TdIsTLg7RQM.mp4,It's worth noting that PCR testing is very complicated and costly and not all Health Care Facilities have the ability to perform.
4686,TdIsTLg7RQM.mp4,It facilities that can't run this type of test may have to send patient samples to a Reference Laboratory and wait several days for the results on the other side of this spectrum.
4687,TdIsTLg7RQM.mp4,The FDA has also approved a few.
4688,TdIsTLg7RQM.mp4,Rapid PCR based tests that give results in less than an hour at least initially.
4689,TdIsTLg7RQM.mp4,These rapid tests were reserved for triaging patients in hospitals and for testing healthcare workers.
4690,TdIsTLg7RQM.mp4,Now that the production of these tests has ramped up further rapid Corona testing centers for the general public are starting to open in several States across the u.s.
4691,T-1-mlAGu1Y.mp4,When the doctor came in and told us told me that the test was positive.
4692,T-1-mlAGu1Y.mp4,I just started crying and my initial response thoughts were I don't understand we stayed at home.
4693,T-1-mlAGu1Y.mp4,We pulled him out.
4694,T-1-mlAGu1Y.mp4,Out of activities that was immediately followed by oh my gosh.
4695,T-1-mlAGu1Y.mp4,He has coronavirus and he continues to get worse every single hour.
4696,T-1-mlAGu1Y.mp4,Where is this headed?
4697,T-1-mlAGu1Y.mp4,And how bad is this going to get?
4698,T-1-mlAGu1Y.mp4,Are you still hungry?
4699,T-1-mlAGu1Y.mp4,What I found most helpful to me in the hospital was just trying to stay present in the moment and not let my mind wander too far down the what if what if he gets worse?
4700,T-1-mlAGu1Y.mp4,What if he gets intubated?
4701,T-1-mlAGu1Y.mp4,What if he gets sedated I never let myself go to the what if he doesn't come home.
4702,T-1-mlAGu1Y.mp4,I just wasn't willing to go to that place and it's really hard to do that as they're turning up the oxygen.
4703,T-1-mlAGu1Y.mp4,"Every hour, but it did really help me."
4704,T-1-mlAGu1Y.mp4,We want to be able to eat obviously love up for the day's delay feel to see I'm just walking that says here.
4705,T-1-mlAGu1Y.mp4,I just don't know if I'm begging you give up any more time here.
4706,T-1-mlAGu1Y.mp4,I mean at that if it's in it's just never ever getting through vote.
4707,T-1-mlAGu1Y.mp4,Like as I say never because speed obviously just that point know who this killer sort of messed up there.
4708,T-1-mlAGu1Y.mp4,My hope is that I don't become somebody who's so overly cautious.
4709,T-1-mlAGu1Y.mp4,I just said I don't allow them to live their lives.
4710,T-1-mlAGu1Y.mp4,But this just really drove it home that my time with my kids is precious.
4711,T-1-mlAGu1Y.mp4,I don't want any parent to be in a position of I call it the Shoulda Coulda woulda's I should have stayed at home.
4712,T-1-mlAGu1Y.mp4,I wish I would have stayed at home of regretting the choices they made because their child gets sick.
4713,T-1-mlAGu1Y.mp4,"It's much easier on a parent to say I did everything possible in this still happened then oh my gosh, we took him to a playground and we didn't take it seriously and look my kid is in the hospital on a ventilator."
4714,otcewi_ycjs.mp4,They say the picture that I gathered the injection when the when the doctor Fascinate a vaccine for covid-19 that hasn't been clinically approved injected straight into the arms of evil in Wu last week the experimental Chinese effort is still in Phase 3 clinical trials significantly short of the typical safety standards for vaccine development.
4715,otcewi_ycjs.mp4,This isn't a trial it's being given to the public at large.
4716,otcewi_ycjs.mp4,I'm a little worried about the experimental.
4717,otcewi_ycjs.mp4,Stage 3 I think I was the one who gathered at his yeah who cheat like the little mouth Evelyn is 20 years old and an economics student at the University of Birmingham.
4718,otcewi_ycjs.mp4,She plans to return to the UK in January.
4719,otcewi_ycjs.mp4,She signed up last Monday as soon as she read about the vaccine online the first toast cost 26 pounds.
4720,otcewi_ycjs.mp4,The second is due next month.
4721,otcewi_ycjs.mp4,"I needed to sign some contracts a told it told me that it erase a file so it's on the stage 3 but for her government approval is more important than scientific a child a China and I think is totally save the vaccine Evelyn took was from sin of a cab beijing-based biotech company, which Sky News visited in May is currently in phase three trials in Turkey Brazil and the UAE and hasn't published results other phase 3 trials from the UK and the US were temporarily pause after participants, but Came seriously ill but China has publicly recorded."
4722,otcewi_ycjs.mp4,Nothing similar and has been steaming ahead since July.
4723,otcewi_ycjs.mp4,It's been giving vaccines to employees as state-owned Enterprises ahead of foreign travel under emergency use approval.
4724,otcewi_ycjs.mp4,People use these people were queuing in Beijing last week for another Chinese vaccine made by Cinnabon.
4725,otcewi_ycjs.mp4,And the program is expanding several cities and towns like this one Josh thing in judging Province East China have advertised the vaccines for local residents.
4726,otcewi_ycjs.mp4,This is a local Clinic where members of the public can sign up to get the vaccine even though it doesn't have full scientific approval the local Disease Control authorities said they were doing this because winter was coming and with it the potential for a second wave.
4727,otcewi_ycjs.mp4,"Otherwise, they would have waited for some that will be rapid for others."
4728,otcewi_ycjs.mp4,It will be Reckless.
4729,otcewi_ycjs.mp4,Feed give some scientist pause the obvious risk is that it won't actually do what its intended to do that.
4730,otcewi_ycjs.mp4,"It won't protect people in the way that they think it might and then of course, there's the the possibility that side effect may not be fully understood yet."
4731,otcewi_ycjs.mp4,The risks are real but Evelyn and many others in China are willing to run them Tom Cheshire Sky News George and province.

4765,nctwbCpkrgo.mp4,Really bad body aches last month 11 alive investigator Andy Purity tested positive for covid-19 and experienced a few of the new symptoms before the CDC added them as official ones.

4774,nctwbCpkrgo.mp4,The CDC says that people develop these emergency warning signs of the virus trouble breathing pain or pressure in the chest bluish slips or face get medical help immediately.
4775,ozeibtfCLAM.mp4,"Okay, Doctor Leibowitz."
4776,ozeibtfCLAM.mp4,My first question is kind of a broad one.
4777,ozeibtfCLAM.mp4,How has the pandemic impacted the collective mental health of the country?
4778,ozeibtfCLAM.mp4,"In a very bad way, I'm afraid."
4779,ozeibtfCLAM.mp4,"You know, it's hard to get precise numbers, but I can speak I think from some epidemiology data than from personal experience."
4780,ozeibtfCLAM.mp4,"If you look at the statistics were put out by the Centers for Disease Control, for example, it looks like there's a big increase and things like anxiety depression traumatic experiences suicidal feelings."
4781,ozeibtfCLAM.mp4,"Abuse all these things these numbers are way up in the population as a whole with particular impacts on selected subgroups and we can go into that, you know terms of age and ethnicity and roles and things like that."
4782,ozeibtfCLAM.mp4,I have a private practice as well and I'm just the increased anxiety and depression that my patients experiencing really is pretty profound and that fits with the epidemiology data because does people who are already experiencing mental health difficulties are really very adversely affected by what's going on as well.
4783,ozeibtfCLAM.mp4,"Okay, I guess there's there's several different parts to it."
4784,ozeibtfCLAM.mp4,There was the lockdowns then there's the social distancing and masks while you are in public.
4785,ozeibtfCLAM.mp4,They're still kind of a stigma behind it gathering in groups does all these little things kind of Collectively make it such a big mental health deal.
4786,ozeibtfCLAM.mp4,I think it's this it's a couple of things one is this disruption of normal life and and and it fits because the people who are most disrupted other ones who have in the most difficulty and then I think that falls on younger people as well teenagers and young adults and things like that.
4787,ozeibtfCLAM.mp4,"For example, there's less seems to be less problems amongst older folks."
4788,ozeibtfCLAM.mp4,Who are still physically healthy and less problems among people who are already retired.
4789,ozeibtfCLAM.mp4,So there's less of a disruption in their life to start with.
4790,ozeibtfCLAM.mp4,"So, I think it's just a disruption is the inability to socialize the uncertainty around work and careers and dating and then the constant Health fears that people have as well that that and again some people are more worried than others, but The other people are just terrified of day-to-day interactions and how safe they are."
4791,ozeibtfCLAM.mp4,"If that is that kind of I mean, I guess we all know if you know someone get who got sick or if you got sick or if you lost your job or if you're financially in a hardship that has obviously a negative impact, but does the not being able to just go out to dinner or go to the gym or do The everyday thing whose have big impacts to those have very big impacts our day-to-day physical and social activities in the routines that we've been in I think are important to sense of well-being and connectedness so not being able to those to do those things for most people are very hard."
4792,ozeibtfCLAM.mp4,"There are some people who tend to be a little more introverted or little shy or a little more inclusive actually find that find it awful, you know, there's less pressure to do things, but that's a that's not a big part of the population."
4793,ozeibtfCLAM.mp4,"Okay, now obviously we have a mental health problem and we've had it prior to covid-19 how have patients who are already struggling with anxiety depression and other disorders reacted to just even more stressed now."
4794,ozeibtfCLAM.mp4,With a lot of difficulty.
4795,ozeibtfCLAM.mp4,I think what I'm seeing is that people who've been fairly stable are much less.
4796,ozeibtfCLAM.mp4,"So right now, you know about the change medication regimens we've had to increase the frequency of counseling sessions."
4797,ozeibtfCLAM.mp4,I've had to offer lots of emergency appointments to and try to make myself very available.
4798,ozeibtfCLAM.mp4,"And I think my colleagues are experiencing this as well and then, you know counseling and psychiatry."
4799,ozeibtfCLAM.mp4,"People reach out to me a lot with questions, you know, can I do this?"
4800,ozeibtfCLAM.mp4,Is it safe to do that?
4801,ozeibtfCLAM.mp4,"Can I you know, I'm answering a lot of a lot of things that are not strictly mental health even but just general support."
4802,ozeibtfCLAM.mp4,"You know, what's safe?"
4803,ozeibtfCLAM.mp4,What's not safe?
4804,ozeibtfCLAM.mp4,What is it?
4805,ozeibtfCLAM.mp4,Okay struggles within a home.
4806,ozeibtfCLAM.mp4,My husband wants to get back to playing tennis.
4807,ozeibtfCLAM.mp4,I'm afraid of that.
4808,ozeibtfCLAM.mp4,You know that kind of thing.
4809,ozeibtfCLAM.mp4,So a lot of that going on a lot of the lot of decisions seem more important.
4810,ozeibtfCLAM.mp4,Orton and more pressing and hard to figure out sometimes
4811,1lJ1PACtmpQ.mp4,Covid vaccine is seen as the great.
4812,1lJ1PACtmpQ.mp4,Hope protecting Health securing the economy a ticket back to normality.
4813,1lJ1PACtmpQ.mp4,"But the UK is only buying doses for those who are most vulnerable that's 30 million people less than half the population Jack Summers volunteered for one of the vaccine trials, despite the emerging risk of long covid."
4814,1lJ1PACtmpQ.mp4,It's by no means certain the young and healthy would actually be protected.
4815,1lJ1PACtmpQ.mp4,I think it will be quite aTalk and I think that probably results from the fact the government has told us so often that this is a sort of a told us about in very simple terms that it's a there will be a vaccine one day and that will solve all our problems in one Fell Swoop.
4816,1lJ1PACtmpQ.mp4,The vaccines task Force's any bought doses on the Assumption will be given to people over 50 those with underlying health problems and to Health and Care workers.
4817,1lJ1PACtmpQ.mp4,"But with so few vaccinated with little Prospect of herd immunity, the virus will still spread this advisor to the World Health Organization says the first vaccines may only take the edge off symptoms to the young and healthy may not benefit if all you know about a vaccine is that it's capable of preventing people from getting sick."
4818,1lJ1PACtmpQ.mp4,Then the only really logical thing you can do with it on that evidence is to try and stop people getting sick and the people who get sick are pretty much the elderly some countries are rolling out the vaccine to everyone herd immunity.
4819,1lJ1PACtmpQ.mp4,He is the explicit goal of Australia to stop the virus spreading.
4820,1lJ1PACtmpQ.mp4,Japan is hoping to secure enough doses to protect his population by next summer.
4821,1lJ1PACtmpQ.mp4,And Germany has also said it's aiming for herd immunity.
4822,1lJ1PACtmpQ.mp4,But the UK is not alone in targeting the vaccine at those most at risk.
4823,1lJ1PACtmpQ.mp4,Canada is drawing up a priority list for the first available doses of vaccine and Belgium is doing the same ethics experts say governments need to be transparent about who gets the vaccine.
4824,1lJ1PACtmpQ.mp4,It's unlikely that a vaccine safe vaccine will be available in enough quantity for it to be distributed to the majority of the population in order to achieve herd immunity instantly or at least very quickly.
4825,1lJ1PACtmpQ.mp4,And so we have to make some difficult ethical decisions around allocation at that point.
4826,1lJ1PACtmpQ.mp4,"First one will be on your right, right?"
4827,1lJ1PACtmpQ.mp4,"Okay, Bingham the UK's vaccines Chief and a volunteer in one of the clinical trials."
4828,1lJ1PACtmpQ.mp4,"Told Sky News earlier this month, but the first vaccines are likely to be only partially effective."
4829,1lJ1PACtmpQ.mp4,"They won't end the pandemic but with luck, they'll stop so many people dying Thomas More Sky News."
4830,vZF4bSwN99M.mp4,lesson on the Corona cro bir us the Coronavirus he's going to find it.
4831,vZF4bSwN99M.mp4,I want you to squish out the meat so it goes there don't hear by Caesars hold us.
4832,vZF4bSwN99M.mp4,It's our dangerous up here.
4833,vZF4bSwN99M.mp4,"So our son has autism and he also has very severe cognitive disability, which also means he has a language disorder and we it's very difficult to function like You can't with him financially."
4834,vZF4bSwN99M.mp4,It's really puts a big burden when you have a child with special needs just for many reasons.
4835,vZF4bSwN99M.mp4,Our sun also has a lot of medical needs so you have to work and be that the same time you have so much at home and literally you can't fit all that in and they're really there really isn't a structure for that.
4836,vZF4bSwN99M.mp4,Everybody's in this free fall that that could become very dire as it goes on.
4837,vZF4bSwN99M.mp4,"Alright, so here we're going on our daily walk."
4838,vZF4bSwN99M.mp4,walk Down to the river PJ.
4839,vZF4bSwN99M.mp4,What are we doing?
4840,vZF4bSwN99M.mp4,"Yeah, dude, we're trying to get more of a kind of schedule going where we generally we have lunch together."
4841,vZF4bSwN99M.mp4,We go outside and walk we socially distance we live right by a park.
4842,vZF4bSwN99M.mp4,"My husband are Educators, but we are not special needs Educators."
4843,vZF4bSwN99M.mp4,And so we're just kind of randomly doing our lessons with him and try our best but he's made a lot of progress in school because of the dedication in the skills of his face.
4844,vZF4bSwN99M.mp4,Lay's teachers and therapists.
4845,vZF4bSwN99M.mp4,"So we just kind of time off what's going to happen, you know a good way to think about it is like typical parents with typical kids are freaking out having their kids at home trying to you know, do the General Ed curriculum and special needs parents."
4846,vZF4bSwN99M.mp4,"They are trying to do the job of six people and so anything that's hard for for a typical family is always, you know, a hundred times harder for families that have special needs."
4847,vZF4bSwN99M.mp4,We work really hard to make sure that our students with disabilities have consistent Services throughout the school year.
4848,vZF4bSwN99M.mp4,"So most of our students receive esy which is called extended school year Services, which mandates that they go to school through the summer because routine is so important for them and we work really hard to get a consistent routine for them and so A disruption Like this is just detrimental to their progress to their families."
4849,vZF4bSwN99M.mp4,"You know, we have what's called a social story to explain that people are sick and we can't go out."
4850,vZF4bSwN99M.mp4,"We kind of thought he kind of understood why he wasn't going to school but even that night before on Sunday, you know before the routine really change."
4851,vZF4bSwN99M.mp4,He was kind of saying want to go to school want to do this.
4852,vZF4bSwN99M.mp4,We're kind of explaining and then he did something he too has not done in a while.
4853,vZF4bSwN99M.mp4,Is he wet the bed very extravagantly through five layers plus a mattress protector.
4854,vZF4bSwN99M.mp4,"And so we're just realizing you know, what even though he's not talking about it."
4855,vZF4bSwN99M.mp4,He's clearly having trouble with this new change.
4856,vZF4bSwN99M.mp4,So we're kind of all like how trying to work this all out and we don't have tons of household help.
4857,vZF4bSwN99M.mp4,It's not like because our son has special needs we have AIDS and nurses everywhere.
4858,vZF4bSwN99M.mp4,It's it's us pretty much.
4859,vZF4bSwN99M.mp4,much
4860,qTrY3lJwxQk.mp4,"Singapore has begun Distributing Trace together tokens to enhance covid-19 contact tracing authorities are hoping to get at least 70 percent of residents covered using the new tokens or the app these tokens complement the mobile app launched about six months ago, which has been downloaded 2.4 million times Geraldine Yap with more seniors in Jalan Besar some of the first to get their hands on the free Trace together token in the island-wide.Allowed the device records data of people do come into close contact with this will make contact tracing faster."
4861,qTrY3lJwxQk.mp4,If any of them has the covid-19 infection the turnout includes those without smartphones as well as others who tried using the app but faced challenges the connection is sometimes break.
4862,qTrY3lJwxQk.mp4,I hope this token is the connections better return to download another app not only to run off.
4863,qTrY3lJwxQk.mp4,Bacteria such as tokens were also handed out at about 20 other community centers.
4864,qTrY3lJwxQk.mp4,"The distribution of the trace together tokens is starting in the Jalan Besar and tanjong pagar districts as these areas have a higher proportion of seniors who are more vulnerable to covid-19 and may have challenges in using the phone app, but collection points will be gradually rolled out across the island from now until November minister in charge of the smart Nation initiative."
4865,qTrY3lJwxQk.mp4,If you can balakrishnan says there isn't a target of how many tokens will be distributed.
4866,qTrY3lJwxQk.mp4,But he hopes the device will encourage more people to participate in the trace together program today.
4867,qTrY3lJwxQk.mp4,We just count the apps.
4868,qTrY3lJwxQk.mp4,"We have about 2.4 million downloads of the app, but the problem with downloads is that not everyone uses it not everyone has it on all the time and they have also been some complaints from some people that are incompatible."
4869,qTrY3lJwxQk.mp4,Abilities with their phone.
4870,qTrY3lJwxQk.mp4,So the token just provides another option the authorities say tokens only exchange Bluetooth signals and won't capture location data.
4871,qTrY3lJwxQk.mp4,The data is also encrypted and all logs will be deleted after 25 days.
4872,IiEE2Tdx_cU.mp4,Our aggressive containment strategy here in the United States has been working and is responsible for the low levels of cases that we have so far.
4873,IiEE2Tdx_cU.mp4,"However, we do expect more cases federal health officials warned the spread of coronavirus in the United States is quote inevitable in quote, but what that spread looks like and how many people could be affected it's unpredictable that makes it hard to be ready experts."
4874,IiEE2Tdx_cU.mp4,Say the most important aspect ofPreparedness for the spread of the virus cost nothing at all.
4875,IiEE2Tdx_cU.mp4,So how should you prepare according to the Centers for Disease Control and prevention?
4876,IiEE2Tdx_cU.mp4,The CDC does not recommend face mask for people who are not showing symptoms.
4877,IiEE2Tdx_cU.mp4,Those should be reserved for healthcare workers and anyone who could potentially transmit the disease some methods are the same as preventing the flu or a common cold from spreading like if you feel sick stay home keep your distance from people who are sick and limit exposure to large.
4878,IiEE2Tdx_cU.mp4,"Oops, doctors researchers and the CDC recommend washing with soap and water for at least 20 seconds after using the bathroom before eating and after blowing your nose or sneezing the CDC also advises not to touch your eyes nose and mouth because the coronavirus can also spread through surfaces clean objects in areas you touch often."
4879,IiEE2Tdx_cU.mp4,Officials also say remain calm and have plans in place in case the outbreak disrupts your daily routine.
4880,IiEE2Tdx_cU.mp4,There is a potential for school closures limited public transportation and overloaded hospitals and Medical Care Facilities.
4881,IiEE2Tdx_cU.mp4,"This could mean stocking up on non-perishable foods daily, medications decongestants anti-inflammatory drugs and acetaminophen in order to have enough to last a couple of weeks to avoid crowds and to minimize your risk of catching the disease look to Are these sources such as the CDC the World Health Organization and local Health Department's to stay informed."
4882,IiEE2Tdx_cU.mp4,We're in this together all of government the public and the private sector and the CDC wants to make sure you have the best information available every day.

4902,KDWN7dydxgU.mp4,We have been talking about the possibility of Airborne transmission an aerosol transmission as one of the modes of transmission of covid-19.
4903,KDWN7dydxgU.mp4,We're also looking at the possible role of Airborne Transmission.
4904,KDWN7dydxgU.mp4,In other settings particularly close settings where you have poor ventilation and we've engaged with a large number of groups epidemiologist and clinicians IPC Specialists Engineers mathematical modelers to try to consolidate the growing knowledge around around transmission.
4905,KDWN7dydxgU.mp4,"When you open an emergency situation like we are and when the since is constantly changing on a daily basis almost, you know, we review some days up to a thousand Publications."
4906,KDWN7dydxgU.mp4,The average is about 500 new Publications a day.
4907,KDWN7dydxgU.mp4,So there's a huge amount of new data that's being put out not all of it is of good quality.
4908,KDWN7dydxgU.mp4,And so we do what's called a living systematic review every week.
4909,KDWN7dydxgU.mp4,We update the review based on the latest and there are hundreds of Publications.
4910,KDWN7dydxgU.mp4,"Now in the area of transmission, we take this very Leslie we are of course focused on on public health guidance."
4911,KDWN7dydxgU.mp4,"And so any guidance that we put out has implications, of course for for billions of people around the world."
4912,KDWN7dydxgU.mp4,So it's it has to be carefully considered.
4913,gaPKKAbzmD0.mp4,So here now is dr. Teslin NG you're an ER doctor from Humber River Hospital fresh off your shift.
4914,gaPKKAbzmD0.mp4,So thank you for coming in sir.
4915,gaPKKAbzmD0.mp4,We look at Italy's wealthy Country top-tier Medical system and yet it's overwhelmed.
4916,gaPKKAbzmD0.mp4,"So what is your ER look like now, so certainly we are seeing increased volumes."
4917,gaPKKAbzmD0.mp4,"We're seeing a lot more pressure on the emergency department system, especially as people are coming in even just for screening if they've had travel history or contact and so we're starting to look at creative ways."
4918,gaPKKAbzmD0.mp4,We can offset some of that volume in our emerge and in ourAlso that we can get to our sickest patients.
4919,gaPKKAbzmD0.mp4,So that's going to look like things like screening centers that are off site not in the hospital and you're going to see I think an increasing number of those across the city and across the provinces and then we're also really talking about how do we get creative about creating capacity in a system that is already close to full capacity.
4920,gaPKKAbzmD0.mp4,So we have surged mechanisms as we call them to get to that overage.
4921,gaPKKAbzmD0.mp4,We see those influenza times and now we're looking at that.
4922,gaPKKAbzmD0.mp4,So how do we get creative about creating space and capacity within our system to see these patients and treat them?
4923,gaPKKAbzmD0.mp4,So that means maybe putting off elective surgeries.
4924,gaPKKAbzmD0.mp4,For example.
4925,gaPKKAbzmD0.mp4,"Yeah, that's a great question."
4926,gaPKKAbzmD0.mp4,"So, you know what when we are talking about that when we need to create space we will do things like canceling elective procedures elective surgeries."
4927,gaPKKAbzmD0.mp4,We can use Virtual care mechanisms off-site screening things like that.
4928,gaPKKAbzmD0.mp4,"So what is Canada's medical system, do you think actually need to stock up on at the moment?"
4929,gaPKKAbzmD0.mp4,Yeah.
4930,gaPKKAbzmD0.mp4,So when patients are coming into the hospital requiring hospitalization because of covid-19.
4931,gaPKKAbzmD0.mp4,We're seeing a real Spectrum in terms of what they need right from something just like supplemental oxygen.
4932,gaPKKAbzmD0.mp4,Nation right up through an ICU bed and ventilation.
4933,gaPKKAbzmD0.mp4,So we're really having conversations at the hospital level to look at what capacity we have for ICU beds and for ventilators as an example.
4934,gaPKKAbzmD0.mp4,And then what we really need to do is look at sharing right and so we do normally transport patients from hospital to hospital if we need to because one hospitals that capacity one another isn't how do we do that safely?
4935,gaPKKAbzmD0.mp4,And how do we do that?
4936,gaPKKAbzmD0.mp4,When there's pressure on all of us of cases may continue to increase in number all the logistics are intense doctor named gee.
4937,gaPKKAbzmD0.mp4,Thanks very much Mike.
4938,gaPKKAbzmD0.mp4,pleasure

4957,1APwq1df6Mw.mp4,Covid-19 is an infectious disease caused by a new coronavirus introduced a human's for the first time.
4958,1APwq1df6Mw.mp4,It is spread from person to person mainly through the droplets produced when an infected person speaks coughs or sneezes these droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby these droplets are too heavy to travel far in the air.
4959,1APwq1df6Mw.mp4,They only travel approximately one meter and quickly settle on surfaces.
4960,1APwq1df6Mw.mp4,"This is the reason person to person spread.Happening mainly between close contacts the exact time that the virus can survive on surfaces is not yet known so it is wise to clean surfaces regularly particularly in the vicinity of people infected with covid-19 hands touch many surfaces, which can be contaminated with the virus."
4961,1APwq1df6Mw.mp4,You should therefore avoid touching your eyes nose or mouth since contaminated hands can transfer the virus from the surface to yourself when coughing or sneezing cover your mouth.
4962,1APwq1df6Mw.mp4,Earth and nose with the bend of your elbow or use the Disposable tissue if a tissue is used discarded immediately into a closed bin the most effective way to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus is to clean your hands frequently with an alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water.
4963,1APwq1df6Mw.mp4,"This will eliminate the virus if it is on your hands, stay healthy and prevent the spread of covid-19."
4964,fgmhm4IX-M8.mp4,"okay, everybody's are type of protein molecule that your immune system produces as it fights infection antibodies circulate in the blood and other body fluids and they act as Sentinels to help keep us healthy and the interesting thing about antibodies is that Are capable of attaching to the specific germs that cause antibodies to be made in the first place."
4965,fgmhm4IX-M8.mp4,So people who are infected with the novel coronavirus make antibodies that specifically recognize that virus and not other types of viruses by analogy think of a lock and key the key is made to open a specific lock and not another lock.
4966,fgmhm4IX-M8.mp4,But we're still learning about the novel coronavirus.
4967,fgmhm4IX-M8.mp4,But we do know that antibodies against it become detectable several days after symptoms begin.
4968,fgmhm4IX-M8.mp4,These antibodies are like fingerprints that tell us the virus has caused an infection and that our immune system has responded.
4969,fgmhm4IX-M8.mp4,Now the strength of the antibody response to the virus really depends on several things like the person's age then nutritional status how severe their covid-19 19 illness was and whether or not they have conditions or taking medications that could affect how well their immune system response.
4970,fgmhm4IX-M8.mp4,"The other important thing to remember is that antibodies usually remain in the blood for some period of time and they act like guards that can quickly restart the immune system or activate the immune system when someone has been exposed a second time to that same infection that caused them to be made now with some infections antibodies not only recognize when a past infection returns, but they also keep us from getting the same illness again, but think of the measles Other times though the protection that antibodies give us less only a short time like we see with seasonal flu."
4971,fgmhm4IX-M8.mp4,"And right now we don't know how long antibodies to the novel coronavirus last or if they even give a short or long-term immunity and that's really important for us to know because doctors want to be able to use the results of these antibody test to determine if someone is immune or not, but we just don't know the answer to that question and until we do Do these antibody tests to novel coronavirus really only tell us that you have had an infection?"
4972,PsKRLJOj1pg.mp4,"You know, we know that most people who develop covid-19 experience only mild symptoms, but new who data came out just yesterday to remind us that 15% developed severe disease 5% critical disease meaning they're on a ventilator in an ICU at our next guest falls into that category."
4973,PsKRLJOj1pg.mp4,His name is Juliana be a Jonah.
4974,PsKRLJOj1pg.mp4,He's just 36 years old.
4975,PsKRLJOj1pg.mp4,He's with us tonight from Montreal.
4976,PsKRLJOj1pg.mp4,"Hello Giuliano Hi, how are you?"
4977,PsKRLJOj1pg.mp4,"I'm really glad to see, you know, I was expecting to speak to you from your hospital."
4978,PsKRLJOj1pg.mp4,Abed but here you are.
4979,PsKRLJOj1pg.mp4,You've just been discharged.
4980,PsKRLJOj1pg.mp4,How does it feel to be home?
4981,PsKRLJOj1pg.mp4,Feels amazing being at the hospital for such a long time and by yourself because you're not allowed visitors really takes a toll on you at some point.
4982,PsKRLJOj1pg.mp4,So I'm really happy.
4983,PsKRLJOj1pg.mp4,I'm back home and eat like home food and be with my girlfriend and my things it's really helps with the recovery.
4984,PsKRLJOj1pg.mp4,"For sure that fantastic when you said you in the hospital for some time weeks and weeks you contracted coronavirus when you are on a trip to San Martin back in mid-march and when you got home, I know you became very ill very We fast what were your symptoms how do they progress first symptoms were pretty like flu-like symptoms mild, but then as the days go the went by it went worse and worse and worse at some point fever was out of control."
4985,PsKRLJOj1pg.mp4,I was almost at 40 I couldn't like handle myself properly.
4986,PsKRLJOj1pg.mp4,I couldn't walk properly and then my breathing became really really problematic.
4987,PsKRLJOj1pg.mp4,So we decided to call 911.
4988,PsKRLJOj1pg.mp4,"Well, first of all, we call 811 114 to get more information if we should go there or not and then they told us to definitely call 911."
4989,PsKRLJOj1pg.mp4,So I did go to the hospital and they discharged me there the next morning because I'd only had up pneumonia even though I was positive for covid.
4990,PsKRLJOj1pg.mp4,I went back home.
4991,PsKRLJOj1pg.mp4,"My girlfriend saw me and she was like, you look like miserable right now."
4992,PsKRLJOj1pg.mp4,I stayed home for that night and the next morning.
4993,PsKRLJOj1pg.mp4,I couldn't breathe like at all.
4994,PsKRLJOj1pg.mp4,So we call 911 again.
4995,PsKRLJOj1pg.mp4,And then stage two days in the ICU and then they put me on a respirator for six days.
4996,PsKRLJOj1pg.mp4,And then I did some blood clot in my lungs.
4997,PsKRLJOj1pg.mp4,So went back to the ICU for another four or five days that I went back to the regular room for another four days.
4998,PsKRLJOj1pg.mp4,"Oh my God, what a what an ordeal but tell me about that moment when you go to hospital and we hear from the doctors that they are going to put you on a ventilator."
4999,PsKRLJOj1pg.mp4,What was that moment like to be honest with you?
5000,PsKRLJOj1pg.mp4,I was it was it wasn't that bad because cuz I was such so much in pain.
5001,PsKRLJOj1pg.mp4,I was so much in distress.
5002,PsKRLJOj1pg.mp4,I was so tired and exhausted from everything that happened in the last week because I spent like a whole week at home being really really sick.
5003,PsKRLJOj1pg.mp4,"So at that point, I was like, please just help me just like do anything and to be honest with you being out of it like in a coma I was like this sounds great because I'm not going to feel the fever."
5004,PsKRLJOj1pg.mp4,I'm not going to feel the pain for a while.
5005,PsKRLJOj1pg.mp4,So and I might even wake up better.
5006,PsKRLJOj1pg.mp4,I might die but at that point it was it was really neat.
5007,PsKRLJOj1pg.mp4,"Desperate Measures, so I was like just do what you have to do."
5008,PsKRLJOj1pg.mp4,But that point I might die.
5009,PsKRLJOj1pg.mp4,I mean the vast majority of people Juliana who do go on to a ventilator do in fact pass away.
5010,PsKRLJOj1pg.mp4,They don't survive what did doctors tell you about how close you were to death and why you were able to pull through they don't tell you because they don't want you to panic.
5011,PsKRLJOj1pg.mp4,I guess they just they always do the same thing.
5012,PsKRLJOj1pg.mp4,They couldn't tell you what's going on.
5013,PsKRLJOj1pg.mp4,What's happening right now what's going to happen next and the risks related to?
5014,PsKRLJOj1pg.mp4,"To it, but they always put you in like in a confidence place where you you, you know, you're the right place with the right people and they're doing their best."
5015,PsKRLJOj1pg.mp4,So at that point if it's not working nothing is going to work right so I didn't I didn't feel like a stress stress about it.
5016,PsKRLJOj1pg.mp4,I was pretty very calm very exhausted very tired.
5017,PsKRLJOj1pg.mp4,And and I we knew we had to do something big to make it happen.
5018,PsKRLJOj1pg.mp4,"Well, it's happen and we're certainly glad to see you tonight as strong as As you sound and look to us continued recovery Giuliano and thank you for sharing your story."
5019,PsKRLJOj1pg.mp4,Thank you so much for calling.
5020,g9PUixw6wTo.mp4,"Hi, my name is Laura Fenster Rothschild and I am a covid success story."
5021,g9PUixw6wTo.mp4,I have been married for 16 years.
5022,g9PUixw6wTo.mp4,We have spent most of our time in New Jersey New Jersey is our home we both grew up in the same place.
5023,g9PUixw6wTo.mp4,My son Harris is 10 soon-to-be 11.
5024,g9PUixw6wTo.mp4,We are basically healthy people and we're just sort of living our lives and taking the best precautions that we knew at the time washing our hands.
5025,g9PUixw6wTo.mp4,But it could happen to anyone.
5026,g9PUixw6wTo.mp4,At first I just thought it was a cold or allergies and it got progressively worse.
5027,g9PUixw6wTo.mp4,I was having a lot of trouble breathing.
5028,g9PUixw6wTo.mp4,It was very scary.
5029,g9PUixw6wTo.mp4,"I you know, I've had asthma attacks before I knew that when I took medication they would calm down."
5030,g9PUixw6wTo.mp4,This was very different.
5031,g9PUixw6wTo.mp4,It didn't matter what I did or any of the techniques.
5032,g9PUixw6wTo.mp4,I knew it just felt as if all the oxygen in my body had been depleted.
5033,g9PUixw6wTo.mp4,My husband dropped me at the door of the emergency room at Penn Medicine Princeton Medical Center and that's scary and scary for him and scary for me and certainly scary for her son who was home trying to figure out what would happen and the nurses took me from there and they were really great the team in the emergency room worked as quickly as they could to make sure that they had tested me and got me a spot in the hospital and I felt as safe as you could in such a scary situation when patients come in.
5034,g9PUixw6wTo.mp4,"Often just very fearful because there is a lot of uncertainty but we do always just try to reassure them that you know, they're doing well and kind of encourage them to stay positive."
5035,g9PUixw6wTo.mp4,We do try to spend some time.
5036,g9PUixw6wTo.mp4,Not only just carrying for them physically but also emotionally and try to eat some of their worries and stress while they're alone in the hospital.
5037,g9PUixw6wTo.mp4,"You don't expect to not have people closer to you physically when you're in a medical circumstance, but the team would communicate or offer to communicate with my family when needed and things were worse."
5038,g9PUixw6wTo.mp4,We also do have an iPad that was supplied to the unit where we can FaceTime patients family members.
5039,g9PUixw6wTo.mp4,So it's always nice to see their face kind of light up when they get to see their loved one and hear their loved one for the first time this app.
5040,g9PUixw6wTo.mp4,Everyone is so supportive to make sure that patients are taking care of everyone has come together in an incredible way.
5041,g9PUixw6wTo.mp4,My doctors were committed to having me be able to breathe on my own for as long as They could they knew that if they did everything they could and tried to keep me calm and using the best interventions possible that the likelihood of recovery would be the best.
5042,g9PUixw6wTo.mp4,They saved my life and they're going to save lots of other lives and they're the real heroes in the situation.
5043,g9PUixw6wTo.mp4,So while my husband was coming to pick me up he said well Harris has something for the nurses.
5044,g9PUixw6wTo.mp4,I'm Harris Lost Child.
5045,g9PUixw6wTo.mp4,I was definitely frightened when my mom was in the hospital the doctors really did save her life.
5046,g9PUixw6wTo.mp4,So I wanted to thank them in any way I could tear a stock ters nurses and staff.
5047,g9PUixw6wTo.mp4,Thank you for taking care of my mom and making sure she stayed healthy so that she could get better.
5048,g9PUixw6wTo.mp4,I am very Happy that she can now come home.

5053,g9PUixw6wTo.mp4,It was great.
5054,g9PUixw6wTo.mp4,It spread a lot of smiles and definitely uplifted spirits on the unit that makes me feel happy that they put it up.
5055,g9PUixw6wTo.mp4,"We've seen a lot of patients go home healthy, which has been great and our numbers do seem to be going down."
5056,g9PUixw6wTo.mp4,"So so definitely feeling like there's some light at the end of the tunnel now, we trusted the doctors and the staff and we're super grateful."
5057,g9PUixw6wTo.mp4,I got the best care right in our backyard.

5062,94aWOD6l-G8.mp4,And what about those masks that are selling out online and in stores or doctors say save your money.
5063,94aWOD6l-G8.mp4,"We need more information before we can say well, you know by this mask or inside the hospital we know what to do but out in the community."
5064,94aWOD6l-G8.mp4,Is it going to help we don't know yet with limited information from the CDC surrounding the coronavirus.

5071,94aWOD6l-G8.mp4,Now when it comes to wipes a doctor tells us they do protect you but only on the surfaces that you actually wipe down and then touch so you have to wipe down everything you come in contact with for them to be effective.

5115,GoXxmzKdick.mp4,Nothing like an early morning jog.
5116,GoXxmzKdick.mp4,What?
5117,GoXxmzKdick.mp4,Oh stop it.
5118,GoXxmzKdick.mp4,"Dear Tim and Moby, I've been hearing lots of scary stuff in the news about the coronavirus."
5119,GoXxmzKdick.mp4,"Can you tell me more about it, please?"
5120,GoXxmzKdick.mp4,"Thanks, Khalil."
5121,GoXxmzKdick.mp4,Sure thing.
5122,GoXxmzKdick.mp4,Khalil viruses are tiny particles that can invade living cells.
5123,GoXxmzKdick.mp4,There are millions of varieties with different behaviors shapes and structures coronavirus is our one group named for their Crown shaped outline four of these commonly infect humans.
5124,GoXxmzKdick.mp4,A lot of times when you get a cold.
5125,GoXxmzKdick.mp4,It's caused by a Coronavirus.
5126,GoXxmzKdick.mp4,"Any virus has one goal to replicate or make more copies of itself, but it can't do that on its own."
5127,GoXxmzKdick.mp4,So it invades an organism and turns its cells into virus factories.
5128,GoXxmzKdick.mp4,This can be unpleasant for the host the organism that the virus has infected the new coronavirus typically causes coughing and fever a healthy body can usually fight off this illness known as covid-19 on its own symptoms are mild for most people especially kids.
5129,GoXxmzKdick.mp4,But in a body with weaken defenses covid-19 can become more severe and require medical treatment.
5130,GoXxmzKdick.mp4,Some people get seriously ill and that's gotten everyone's attention.
5131,GoXxmzKdick.mp4,This new coronavirus was first identified in Wuhan China in late 2019.
5132,GoXxmzKdick.mp4,There was an outbreak that's when a disease starts spreading more and more people got sick first in China and then around the world entire cities have been quarantined or closed off to slow.
5133,GoXxmzKdick.mp4,"The disease has spread fortunately viruses can't get around without our help and there's a lot we can do to not help them like washing your hands, especially after you use the bathroom."
5134,GoXxmzKdick.mp4,And before you eat that's always a good idea and you probably already do it scrub with soap for at least 20 seconds to make sure you don't miss any spots whenever you cough or sneeze cover.
5135,GoXxmzKdick.mp4,Nose and mouth to help keep any germs contained.
5136,GoXxmzKdick.mp4,And if you're sick avoid other people you wouldn't want to infect them.
5137,GoXxmzKdick.mp4,Even if it's a plain old cold.
5138,GoXxmzKdick.mp4,"Well, when there's an outbreak where you live experts recommend some added precautions like social distancing limiting close contact with other people."
5139,GoXxmzKdick.mp4,Even if you're not sick hang out at home with your family and keep up with your friends online that gives the virus fewer opportunities to spread around.
5140,GoXxmzKdick.mp4,Lots of outbreaks have been stopped when enough folks just follow these Simple Rules.
5141,GoXxmzKdick.mp4,"Yeah, it's true."
5142,GoXxmzKdick.mp4,Some people have died after being infected by the 2019 coronavirus.
5143,GoXxmzKdick.mp4,That's because the virus can infect a person's lungs and make it hard to breathe.
5144,GoXxmzKdick.mp4,Those are the stories we hear about most online and in the news but the vast majority of cases have been mild if you feel overwhelmed by the news consider limiting how much you let in.
5145,GoXxmzKdick.mp4,Instead of cable news and social media stick to sources like the World Health Organization.
5146,GoXxmzKdick.mp4,They'll give you the big picture not just the scary snapshots that make the headlines and they're organizing experts all over the world to get this coronavirus under control still.
5147,GoXxmzKdick.mp4,It's totally normal.

5149,GoXxmzKdick.mp4,They can help you put your feelings in perspective.
5150,GoXxmzKdick.mp4,One last thing coronavirus doesn't care where you're from or what your background is.
5151,GoXxmzKdick.mp4,So don't let anyone turn this into an excuse to Target someone based on how they look.
5152,GoXxmzKdick.mp4,Working together as how we'll beat this thing.

5167,TXSKQzJptDI.mp4,"If you are currently infected it isn't able to determine whether you had have had the virus for ready and since recovered it can help ever show if you are infected but don't have any symptoms IE if you are asymptomatic, so now I'm going to show you how to take the sample thoroughly wash your hands before beginning unscrew the swab and carefully inserted into the throne."
5168,TXSKQzJptDI.mp4,You want to gently swipe the back of the throat a few times to ensure a proper sample has been collected also as per instructions included insert the swab into the nose and just rotate it a few times in order for accurate sample collection.
5169,TXSKQzJptDI.mp4,Once this is done simply reinsert the swab into its protective tube and resealed after you've collected the sample and reseal the tube.
5170,TXSKQzJptDI.mp4,Make sure your details are noted property on the label and pop this into the prepaid envelope drop this into Nearest post box and within two to three working days of receiving of sample on lab will deliver the relevant results.
5171,TXSKQzJptDI.mp4,If you do test positive for covid-19 public health England will be automatically notified in order to support accurate test reporting.
5172,TXSKQzJptDI.mp4,You should also Follow The Official Guidelines and self isolate for at least 14 days along with any other residents of your home who have come into contact with you.
5173,TXSKQzJptDI.mp4,If you test negative then your sample will not have shown the virus to be present.
5174,TXSKQzJptDI.mp4,Please do be mindful.
5175,TXSKQzJptDI.mp4,Not all tests are a hundred percent accurate and it is possible that you may have a false negative result.
5176,TXSKQzJptDI.mp4,"This is when the test comes back as being negative, but you do actually carry the virus and that's it."
5177,TXSKQzJptDI.mp4,It's that simple if you'd like to test yourself a covid-19 at home.
5178,TXSKQzJptDI.mp4,We want to keep some test handy in case symptoms start to appear book a consultation using the link below and one will be sent directly to your door.
5179,TXSKQzJptDI.mp4,Thanks so much for listening guys.
5180,TXSKQzJptDI.mp4,"I hope that's been useful informative if you do have any comments or questions, please Pop them on the boxes below and we'll get back to you as soon as we can."
5181,HADcz6uvfwY.mp4,Pandemonium and panic has officially set in so it's time for us to get prepared for the coronavirus.
5182,HADcz6uvfwY.mp4,One of us is more freaked out than the other.
5183,HADcz6uvfwY.mp4,I'm prepared this point.
5184,HADcz6uvfwY.mp4,Let's do it.
5185,HADcz6uvfwY.mp4,But first have you subscribed to this YouTube channel?
5186,HADcz6uvfwY.mp4,"If not, please do so now so we can, you know, keep doing this first things first."
5187,HADcz6uvfwY.mp4,I noticed that we were officially in panic mode.
5188,HADcz6uvfwY.mp4,When I tried to go to Costco last night to buy some toilet paper and completely sold out not one role in all of Costco.
5189,HADcz6uvfwY.mp4,I don't know that I'm officially panicking or anything yet.
5190,HADcz6uvfwY.mp4,But I feel like I've got to go stock up because other people already taken everything.
5191,HADcz6uvfwY.mp4,"So if something if I do have to be quarantined to my house for a couple weeks, I just need some supplies."
5192,HADcz6uvfwY.mp4,So we're going to go get the supplies.
5193,HADcz6uvfwY.mp4,We're going to get set up to it.
5194,HADcz6uvfwY.mp4,Let's go get prepared.
5195,HADcz6uvfwY.mp4,"All right, look, he's taking precautions over there, right Beverly."
5196,HADcz6uvfwY.mp4,Hey Beverly.
5197,HADcz6uvfwY.mp4,We're doing a video mom is the coronavirus.
5198,HADcz6uvfwY.mp4,Is that why you're here?
5199,HADcz6uvfwY.mp4,"No, girl."
5200,HADcz6uvfwY.mp4,You look great.
5201,HADcz6uvfwY.mp4,I'll see you later.
5202,HADcz6uvfwY.mp4,"But while we're here, let me sanitize when it's time to buy your groceries."
5203,HADcz6uvfwY.mp4,"All you need is like what you would normally buy a week's worth of groceries, maybe a little more and don't forget you still are going to have power at your house."
5204,HADcz6uvfwY.mp4,"So can still buy Refrigeration when it comes to things like produce don't buy things with the shortest shelf life, like apples are good and you know things like that that are going to last a while."
5205,HADcz6uvfwY.mp4,So let's get to Shaman of course canned items are good.
5206,HADcz6uvfwY.mp4,Because if you're stocking up for more than a week you might run out of refrigeration room meat is the same thing as produce.
5207,HADcz6uvfwY.mp4,So you got to get things that are going to last more than a couple days or things that you can put in your freezers.
5208,HADcz6uvfwY.mp4,They're not sold out of toilet paper yet.
5209,HADcz6uvfwY.mp4,"Okay once Again, you just need to get there a couple weeks."
5210,HADcz6uvfwY.mp4,I don't know how many toilet paper how much toilet paper you go through but leave some for the other people bleach is definitely running out.
5211,HADcz6uvfwY.mp4,And this is one of the things that I will clean with to get any germs if we happen to get the virus gotta have the bleach Nicole is seriously looking for actual Corona.
5212,HADcz6uvfwY.mp4,This is not a joking manner.
5213,HADcz6uvfwY.mp4,I'm not joking.
5214,HADcz6uvfwY.mp4,We're going to be doing a lot of family bonding and we're all stuck in the house.
5215,HADcz6uvfwY.mp4,We're going to be playing cards having a cocktail and I'm not doing this to be funny.
5216,HADcz6uvfwY.mp4,I actually like Corona.
5217,HADcz6uvfwY.mp4,Snacks if my kids are home from school for more than week.
5218,HADcz6uvfwY.mp4,I might go crazy and they will be eating a lot of junk will make up for it later coffee.
5219,HADcz6uvfwY.mp4,It look have to wake up every morning and have coffee if I'm gonna be locked in my house.
5220,HADcz6uvfwY.mp4,"All right, I think we're ready."
5221,HADcz6uvfwY.mp4,I'm going to take you to my house and show you a couple more tips for getting ready for being quarantined for the Coronavirus.
5222,HADcz6uvfwY.mp4,"All right, we're back from the store."
5223,HADcz6uvfwY.mp4,I have stalked my fridge and my pantry with about a week's well week to two weeks worth of groceries.
5224,HADcz6uvfwY.mp4,"What I want to say is, you know, calm down just relax and everything is going to be okay again, I'm not an expert but I believe that we don't need to be in a full Panic at this point."
5225,HADcz6uvfwY.mp4,So use this time if you are quarantined in your home To spend time with your family time to break out the games that you never get to play.
5226,HADcz6uvfwY.mp4,We're always at work.
5227,HADcz6uvfwY.mp4,"So if we have time off of work, I plan to make the most of it and spend a little cutie with my kids."
5228,HADcz6uvfwY.mp4,The schools have also gone A step above and are trying to prepare the kids without scaring the kids.
5229,HADcz6uvfwY.mp4,"So reminder that you can tell your kids that Michaels teacher taught him is what when we wash our hands, what's a good thing to remember?"
5230,HADcz6uvfwY.mp4,Thank Michael twinkle little star two times three times.
5231,HADcz6uvfwY.mp4,Times.
5232,HADcz6uvfwY.mp4,All right.
5233,HADcz6uvfwY.mp4,Let me see.
5234,HADcz6uvfwY.mp4,I'm not saying okay.
5235,HADcz6uvfwY.mp4,I will just sync it to yourself then.
5236,HADcz6uvfwY.mp4,Show me how long it takes to wash our hands.
5237,HADcz6uvfwY.mp4,Little star how I wonder what give me one verse I'll give you $5.00.
5238,HADcz6uvfwY.mp4,"No, I'll give you gum."
5239,HADcz6uvfwY.mp4,That's okay.
5240,HADcz6uvfwY.mp4,I don't have those twinkly twinkly stars in the sky.
5241,HADcz6uvfwY.mp4,Oh my gosh.
5242,HADcz6uvfwY.mp4,Josh does not know it tell him tell him how it goes twinkle twinkle little star how I wonder where you are.
5243,HADcz6uvfwY.mp4,The other one you can also sing happy birthday if you can remember that one.
5244,HADcz6uvfwY.mp4,I hope I've eased your nerves just a little bit.
5245,HADcz6uvfwY.mp4,In the meantime.
5246,HADcz6uvfwY.mp4,Let's save the Vodka for the cocktails.
5247,HADcz6uvfwY.mp4,You're going to need them.
5248,HADcz6uvfwY.mp4,I'm not wearing.
5249,HADcz6uvfwY.mp4,This is a super hot.
5250,HADcz6uvfwY.mp4,Do you need some it's know.
5251,HADcz6uvfwY.mp4,I'm some gloves and I've got more.
5252,HADcz6uvfwY.mp4,Do you know I'm going to practice life like normal.
5253,NQTBlbx1Xjs.mp4,So there's a couple of things in the question that you just asked one is the number of cases that are reported that are being reported as asymptomatic.
5254,NQTBlbx1Xjs.mp4,And so we hear from a number of countries that X number X percentage of them are reported as not having symptoms or that they are in their pre-symptomatic phase which means it's a few days before they actually develop severe symptoms in a number of countries when we go back and we discuss with them one.
5255,NQTBlbx1Xjs.mp4,How are these asymptomatic cases being identified?
5256,NQTBlbx1Xjs.mp4,I'd many of them are being identified through contact tracing and so which is what we would want to see and that you have a known case you find your contacts.
5257,NQTBlbx1Xjs.mp4,"They're already in quarantine, hopefully and some of them are tested and then you pick up people who may have asymptomatic or no symptoms or even mild symptoms."
5258,NQTBlbx1Xjs.mp4,The other thing we're finding is that when we actually go back and say how many of them were truly asymptomatic we find out that many have really mild disease very mild disease.
5259,NQTBlbx1Xjs.mp4,They're not quote unquote.
5260,NQTBlbx1Xjs.mp4,Did symptoms meaning they may not have developed fever yet.
5261,NQTBlbx1Xjs.mp4,They may not have had a significant cough or they may not have shortness of breath.
5262,NQTBlbx1Xjs.mp4,But some may have mild disease having said that we do know that there can be people that are truly asymptomatic and PCR positive.
5263,NQTBlbx1Xjs.mp4,The second part of your question is what proportion of asymptomatic individuals actually transmit.
5264,NQTBlbx1Xjs.mp4,"So the way that we look at that is we look at they need these individuals need to be followed carefully over the course of Of when they're detected and looking at secondary transmission, we have a number of reports from countries who are doing very detailed contact tracing their following asymptomatic cases."
5265,NQTBlbx1Xjs.mp4,They're following contacts and they're not finding secondary transmission on word is very rare and that not much of that is not published in the literature from the papers that are published.
5266,NQTBlbx1Xjs.mp4,There is one that came out from Singapore looking at a long-term care facility.
5267,NQTBlbx1Xjs.mp4,There are some household transmission studies where you follow Jewels over time and you look at the proportion of those that transmit onwards we are constantly looking at this data and we're trying to get more information from countries to truly answer this question.
5268,NQTBlbx1Xjs.mp4,It's still appears to be rare that an asymptomatic individual actually transmits on word.
5269,NQTBlbx1Xjs.mp4,What we really want to be focused on our is following the symptomatic cases if we followed all of the symptomatic cases because we know that this is a respiratory pathogen it passes from an Visual through infectious droplets if we actually followed all of the symptomatic cases obvious elated those cases follow the contacts and quarantine those contexts.
5270,NQTBlbx1Xjs.mp4,We would drastically reduce I would love to be able to give a proportion of how much transmission we would actually stop but it would be a drastic reduction in transmission.
5271,NQTBlbx1Xjs.mp4,If we could focus on that.
5272,NQTBlbx1Xjs.mp4,"I think we would we would do very very well in terms of suppressing transmission, but from the data we have it still seems to be rare that an asymptomatic person actually It's onward to a secondary individual."
5273,ndMrEMyRgQM.mp4,This is Nicole.
5274,ndMrEMyRgQM.mp4,She's a nurse at BC Children's Hospital.
5275,ndMrEMyRgQM.mp4,And she's going to show you everything you need to know about how we do a test for covid-19 a high their first.
5276,ndMrEMyRgQM.mp4,I always put on protective clothing like a mask plastic Eye shield and yellow gown to keep everyone safe from germs for your test.
5277,ndMrEMyRgQM.mp4,"You might sit on your mom or dad's lap unless you're a big kid, then when I sit on a chair or exam table, I'll need to put this small Suave."
5278,ndMrEMyRgQM.mp4,Your nose.
5279,ndMrEMyRgQM.mp4,Can you see how skinny it is?
5280,ndMrEMyRgQM.mp4,It's specially designed to check for a virus that might be way at the back of your nose.
5281,ndMrEMyRgQM.mp4,You'll need to hold your chin up.
5282,ndMrEMyRgQM.mp4,So the swab can reach the back of your nose.
5283,ndMrEMyRgQM.mp4,Mom dad or another grown-up might need to help you.
5284,ndMrEMyRgQM.mp4,Keep still during your test.
5285,ndMrEMyRgQM.mp4,You might like to plan what you want to do with your hands some kids like to hold a squishy ball or their favorite stuffed animal or you might like to hold your parents hands.
5286,ndMrEMyRgQM.mp4,I'll need to measure from your nose to your ear to know how far Swab needs to go inside by the time you count slowly to 5 the test should be over.
5287,ndMrEMyRgQM.mp4,"One, two, three, four five."
5288,ndMrEMyRgQM.mp4,That's it.
5289,ndMrEMyRgQM.mp4,"Some kids say their eyes water and their nose feels warm or tinkly when they have this test kind of like when you get water up your nose or when you drink a really fizzy drink and just so, you know having the test doesn't mean you have the virus."
5290,ndMrEMyRgQM.mp4,We may call your parents later with the test results.
5291,ndMrEMyRgQM.mp4,Thank you for helping us.
5292,ndMrEMyRgQM.mp4,Find out why you're feeling sick.
5293,ndMrEMyRgQM.mp4,Why?
5294,yS8OQpI_9f0.mp4,The transmission is mainly by droplet transmission and with droplets everyone always wants to know about distance and usually we drop the transmission one to two meters is really the distance in which we want to maintain to reduce droplet transmission.
5295,yS8OQpI_9f0.mp4,The main issue really is about droplets and when you You really sing or exercise you exhale and when you exhale then we worry that it's not just droplets but some of the smaller particles that may contain the virus when you breathe heavily during exercise or when you sing or when you shout so as a result these type of activities.
5296,yS8OQpI_9f0.mp4,We do want them to not have for the moment until such.
5297,yS8OQpI_9f0.mp4,"Our level of community transmission really is practically zero, I would say that outdoor transmission risk is very much smaller."
5298,yS8OQpI_9f0.mp4,There is actually one publication in which shows that the risk of indoor transmission is 19 times higher than outdoor transmission.
5299,yS8OQpI_9f0.mp4,"So I think if you're out in the park, I think an open space good ventilation your wrist."
5300,yS8OQpI_9f0.mp4,Of transmission is much lower.
5301,yS8OQpI_9f0.mp4,"But then again, you know, I think you must always think about safe distancing wherever you go, but obviously when you're in the airport terminal on the aircraft, I think the important thing is not to get exposed and get exposed is really from other people whether other people equate to other passengers or sometimes from the air crew and so I think a lot of it is wearing Mass making sure that you clean the surfaces in which you come into contact with and ensuring that throughout the flight."
5302,yS8OQpI_9f0.mp4,Do you have good personal hygiene?
5303,yS8OQpI_9f0.mp4,And I think it really depends on cooperation amongst everybody on board the flight.
5304,yS8OQpI_9f0.mp4,"There are always some questions during air travel about the air exchanges, but most modern aircraft actually have quite good Exchange."
5305,yS8OQpI_9f0.mp4,And that's really built into the aircraft.
5306,yS8OQpI_9f0.mp4,So a lot of times it is really not an Airborne transmission from getting infected from someone 10 rows in front of you but really somebody who's much closer who may cough or sneeze one or two rows ahead of you that you make get transmission.
5307,yS8OQpI_9f0.mp4,So a circulation actually for most modern aircraft.
5308,yS8OQpI_9f0.mp4,It's actually quite well managed.
5309,yS8OQpI_9f0.mp4,And the recent transmission through air ventilation is actually quite small.
5310,yS8OQpI_9f0.mp4,It's really close contact.
5311,yS8OQpI_9f0.mp4,So I think back cenation is always important and I think vaccination does reduce any background noise that we may be concerned about.
5312,yS8OQpI_9f0.mp4,"If you have taken the flu vaccination you're less likely to come down with influenza, and then you're less likely to be flagged up as having fever and sore throat"
5313,vj7OjdpQduY.mp4,Health Regulators giving the green light to resume to Major covid vaccine trials investigators found no evidence that the Unexplained illnesses were related in any way to AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson's vaccine trials.
5314,vj7OjdpQduY.mp4,That's according to the companies themselves the National Institutes of Health helping lead the charge and a search for the vaccine the NIH director.
5315,vj7OjdpQduY.mp4,Dr. Francis Collins joins us now.
5316,vj7OjdpQduY.mp4,Dr. Collins.
5317,vj7OjdpQduY.mp4,Thank you.
5318,vj7OjdpQduY.mp4,Are we getting close or how would you characterize it?
5319,vj7OjdpQduY.mp4,I would say the pace our vaccine development since January has been unprecedented and rather breathtaking when you consider normally every other vaccine we ever tried to prepare his taken four six eight ten years.
5320,vj7OjdpQduY.mp4,And here we are in October expecting that if all goes well we will have at least one vaccine that is proven safe and effective by the end of 2020.
5321,vj7OjdpQduY.mp4,This has never been done before never even close and of course.
5322,vj7OjdpQduY.mp4,Everybody's concerned about is it being done by cutting Corners?
5323,vj7OjdpQduY.mp4,I want to reassure everyone that the safety and the efficacy standards for these vaccines have never been higher you heard about the two trials that were stopped temporarily because somebody and the tens of thousands who are getting the vaccine or maybe a placebo got an illness and you wanted to be sure it wasn't connected that's an indication of how serious the safety standards are but it's looking promising.
5324,vj7OjdpQduY.mp4,I gotta tell you there's still all kinds of uncertainties here.
5325,vj7OjdpQduY.mp4,And until we have that judgment that we got there.
5326,vj7OjdpQduY.mp4,"Let's be careful and not over assume that conclusion, but it's looking pretty good."
5327,vj7OjdpQduY.mp4,Love to hear that.
5328,vj7OjdpQduY.mp4,Dr. Collins.
5329,vj7OjdpQduY.mp4,Here's the thing.
5330,vj7OjdpQduY.mp4,I didn't understand.
5331,vj7OjdpQduY.mp4,I always figured if it's good for an adult.
5332,vj7OjdpQduY.mp4,It's a vaccine it's good for kids.
5333,vj7OjdpQduY.mp4,"But now I know it is it and that they've just started testing one that Pfizer just got a green light to test for kids why so late on that, you know, it's not that late these vaccine trials big scale phase 3 as they're called really only got started at the end of July and October."
5334,vj7OjdpQduY.mp4,I think this is the ethical approach don't want to with a vaccine where you're not quite sure whether there might be some safety issues.
5335,vj7OjdpQduY.mp4,Start giving that to Children until you've tried it out a bit on people who may be better able to handle a side effect.
5336,vj7OjdpQduY.mp4,But the time is now coming and Pfizer has announced they're going to start offering this to children and their parents in Trials down to age 12.
5337,vj7OjdpQduY.mp4,I think other companies will probably follow suit.
5338,vj7OjdpQduY.mp4,It's a balanced Shepherd you do want to be sure that kids have access to the vaccine because they're going to need it to but you don't want to jump into that too early when they are the most vulnerable little people and we want to be sure we don't do hot.
5339,vj7OjdpQduY.mp4,One little covid monsters.
5340,vj7OjdpQduY.mp4,"They don't show signs, but they spread it to Grandma."
5341,vj7OjdpQduY.mp4,Doctor is great to hear from you tonight encouraging and we thank you.
5342,vj7OjdpQduY.mp4,All right.
5343,vj7OjdpQduY.mp4,Glad to be with you Shepard Smith here.
5344,vj7OjdpQduY.mp4,Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube.
5345,WHEtad87w-E.mp4,Hello.
5346,WHEtad87w-E.mp4,So today I'm going to do a little bit of clarification.
5347,WHEtad87w-E.mp4,You can call it debunking if you'd like.
5348,WHEtad87w-E.mp4,"But I prefer clarification so across the news media, especially in Canada and also in some international news agencies as well."
5349,WHEtad87w-E.mp4,We've been talking a lot about a natural plant derived ingredient called Corson and the reason why there's been lots of talk about it is because the possibility of it beingA broad-spectrum antiviral option and the reason why we've been chatting about it so much here in Canada is because the research has been happening and continues to happen.
5350,WHEtad87w-E.mp4,You're in Canada in Montreal to scientists Michelle creatinine and he is this the brother of chakra ta who was our prime minister for about 10 years and his colleague.
5351,WHEtad87w-E.mp4,Mahjongg.
5352,WHEtad87w-E.mp4,BK was a Congolese scientist and work together working in Montreal and they did some research you.
5353,WHEtad87w-E.mp4,Using the Kirsten ingredient on mice who were infected with Ebola with some great success.
5354,WHEtad87w-E.mp4,"And the reason why they be searched at started was actually as a result of SARS, which is a severe acute respiratory syndrome, which is a coronavirus related syndrome."
5355,WHEtad87w-E.mp4,And that is something that hit Canada pretty hard a lot of countries throughout the world as a result of that they started doing research on it.
5356,WHEtad87w-E.mp4,So I'm going to stress you.
5357,WHEtad87w-E.mp4,That the research has only been on mice.
5358,WHEtad87w-E.mp4,"Okay, so it's very encouraging and they are striving to gather up the funds in order to do uman clinical trials."
5359,WHEtad87w-E.mp4,So understand that we don't have any proof that that positive result is going to transfer into humans as yet because we haven't done any human clinical trials and usually clinical trials will take several months to complete and then we can possibly start talking about Out using it as an option as an antiviral.
5360,WHEtad87w-E.mp4,So at this point right now courses and we don't know the dose.
5361,WHEtad87w-E.mp4,We don't know how much you can use without even knowing if it would be useful.
5362,WHEtad87w-E.mp4,So please don't go and bulk by Christian and take bucket loads of it with the expectation that it's going to clear up a very serious viral infection like coronavirus.
5363,WHEtad87w-E.mp4,"Okay, so some clarifications or potential, but it's again it's a waiting game for us to see the results."
5364,WHEtad87w-E.mp4,All right if you have Questions about things you see popping up in the news media.
5365,WHEtad87w-E.mp4,Please.
5366,WHEtad87w-E.mp4,Feel free to drop me a line put a comment in to the bottom of this video.
5367,WHEtad87w-E.mp4,Send me a private message if you'd like and I'd be happy to do the research and find out whether it's true false or somewhere in between.
5368,WHEtad87w-E.mp4,All right.
5369,WHEtad87w-E.mp4,"So if you like this video, please consider clicking the like button and if you find out what I'm offering useful then consider subscribing to this YouTube channel."
5370,WHEtad87w-E.mp4,Thank you so much.

5384,dYs0RKNIMKM.mp4,We are all waiting and hoping for good news here.
5385,dYs0RKNIMKM.mp4,Good morning to you.
5386,dYs0RKNIMKM.mp4,"Good morning, Gala readout from modernist phase 3 trial could come by November."
5387,dYs0RKNIMKM.mp4,So there is a chance a vaccine could be ready by the end of the year volunteers have started receiving either the vaccine or a placebo in this blind study that experts.
5388,dYs0RKNIMKM.mp4,Hope couldn't finally bring this coronavirus pandemic under control.
5389,dYs0RKNIMKM.mp4,It seems quite possible that we may very well have results by November or December maybe possibly a little earlier National Institutes of Health director.
5390,dYs0RKNIMKM.mp4,"Dr. Francis Collins has high hopes for the vaccine his agency developed with moderna and says 30,000 volunteers are being chosen based on their risk of exposure will be in areas where the virus is still spreading."
5391,dYs0RKNIMKM.mp4,We will see whether any of them actually get sick.
5392,dYs0RKNIMKM.mp4,Dr. Hannah else alive.
5393,dYs0RKNIMKM.mp4,"One of only three moderna principal investigators overseeing the 89 test sites says if the vaccine can work in over half the volunteers, it would be a major step to protecting the entire country."
5394,dYs0RKNIMKM.mp4,"I've seen some modeling around what level of immunity is needed and the modeling places it at somewhere between 50 and 60 percent third immunity visors late-stage trial announced Monday will also include 30,000 participants and 39 you US states as well as Brazil Germany and Argentina both vaccines use a piece of RNA genetic code which tells the cells in the body to make a safe modified version of the viral protein that triggers an immune response to fight the virus TV."
5395,dYs0RKNIMKM.mp4,"Anchor Don Baker former Savannah, Georgia affiliate got the very first dose of the moderna vaccine Monday morning."
5396,dYs0RKNIMKM.mp4,I got tired of just sitting here worried that I can't do any more than wear masks and try to stay away from people.
5397,dYs0RKNIMKM.mp4,It's good to know that I could be a part of what could be the ultimate solution.
5398,dYs0RKNIMKM.mp4,"But even if a vaccine is approved and available, there's some question as to how many would take it a CBS News poll on Monday showed only 30% of adults would get a vaccine as soon as possible 50% would consider it or wait to see what happens in twenty percent said they'd never get one CBS News medical contributor."
5399,dYs0RKNIMKM.mp4,Dr. David agus says the usual financial and Regulatory hurdles.
5400,dYs0RKNIMKM.mp4,Owls were pushed aside when it came to the development of a covid vaccine.
5401,dYs0RKNIMKM.mp4,We've compressed it all into an amazing time period because we need it because there was no choice.
5402,dYs0RKNIMKM.mp4,This is a war on our soil and we have to respond.
5403,dYs0RKNIMKM.mp4,Top health officials including dr. Anthony fauci stress no measures are being cut in the development of any of these vaccines.
5404,dYs0RKNIMKM.mp4,"Dr. David agus says all safety Protocols are being followed, except one long-term studies and that simply because we need the vaccine now Anthony, I sure do Meg."
5405,dYs0RKNIMKM.mp4,Thank you very much.

5422,ghNY6U19l-s.mp4,"Those with underlying medical conditions are more risk for severe illness if infected with the coronavirus, but a recent study finds at least one common condition also raises the risk of death from covid-19."
5423,ghNY6U19l-s.mp4,Mandy Gaither has more in today's Health minute more than 100 million Americans have high blood pressure according to the American Heart Association in a recent study published in the European.
5424,ghNY6U19l-s.mp4,"Heart Journal.Find those patients also have twice the risk of dying from covid-19 researchers studied records of more than 2,800 patients treated in Wuhan China One of the study's lead."
5425,ghNY6U19l-s.mp4,"Authors says nearly half of the patients who died had high blood pressure, which was a much higher percentage compared to those who only had mild covid-19 symptoms the group also looked at high blood pressure medicines."
5426,ghNY6U19l-s.mp4,Some doctors had feared a stew Inhibitors and arbs could make it.
5427,ghNY6U19l-s.mp4,"Easier for the virus to infect cells but the study found the opposite based on their findings researchers suggest patients, not discontinue or change their usual antihypertensive treatment unless instructed by a doctor."
5428,ghNY6U19l-s.mp4,"They say it's important for those with high blood pressure to realize their increased risk to take good care of themselves during this pandemic and if they're infected with coronavirus, they may need more medical attention for today's Health minute a Mandy Gaither."

5430,m9vvkfRx_Mc.mp4,Tension out to everything going on with the coronavirus and some interesting news coming out of the airline's face.
5431,m9vvkfRx_Mc.mp4,And on the rapid testing front Anjali Kalani joins us now for the latest on all of that Anjali.
5432,m9vvkfRx_Mc.mp4,Thanks Molly up interesting on the airline's front is at United Airlines is offering is going to offer free tests for flights to London.
5433,m9vvkfRx_Mc.mp4,And that's a sort of an attempt to Spur that international travel that has been halted.
5434,m9vvkfRx_Mc.mp4,We know that airports have been in some Airlines have already been offering this.
5435,m9vvkfRx_Mc.mp4,"Oh, this is just another one of those.Announcements to sort of tack on to that Trend so we'll see how much it actually does pick up as most people remain pretty cautious and wary at this time moving on to the vaccine front we heard from a derna."
5436,m9vvkfRx_Mc.mp4,They have really been setting up and gearing up for this distribution of their vaccine looking at when they might actually be ready to start distribution.
5437,m9vvkfRx_Mc.mp4,"Of course, we don't know the end date right now, but we know it we do know that interim results are at least going to be available by November and so that will Give us some indication of whether or not they'll be ready to go out."
5438,m9vvkfRx_Mc.mp4,They already have more than a billion dollars in deposits for these vaccines for that demand.
5439,m9vvkfRx_Mc.mp4,Of course that we know and they are of course one of the two Front Runners in the country along with Pfizer mean all the treatments space them some interesting news out actually regeneron with their antibody cocktail treatment.
5440,m9vvkfRx_Mc.mp4,The one that President Trump did receive when he was in the hospital is showing some promising results and this comes a couple days after we learned that Eli Lilly had to stop their trial for their single.
5441,m9vvkfRx_Mc.mp4,Treatment but they are also looking to sort of shift to a less serious patients but regenerations did prove effective and more serious patients.
5442,m9vvkfRx_Mc.mp4,And so that does prove hopeful for their emergency use authorization filing that is still in Q.
5443,m9vvkfRx_Mc.mp4,We know that Eli Lilly by comparison does also still have their emergency use authorization and Clay but it but is more focused on that less severe population.
5444,m9vvkfRx_Mc.mp4,"So could we that we have, you know different treatments for different severities, which is what I say."
5445,m9vvkfRx_Mc.mp4,"Experts are really looking for also now for Gilead, of course their room disappear."
5446,m9vvkfRx_Mc.mp4,The first approved branded drug to treat covid is already out there.
5447,m9vvkfRx_Mc.mp4,"They did report yesterday that they had eight hundred and seventy three million dollars in sales for the third quarter and that's a pretty high number considering that, you know the results for them."
5448,m9vvkfRx_Mc.mp4,And the sort of expert opinion on them is really mixed.
5449,m9vvkfRx_Mc.mp4,We've heard that the World Health Organization and their solidarity trial found that it had very little effect on patients.
5450,m9vvkfRx_Mc.mp4,"Meanwhile, you know here in the US we've seen Some trials as well where the results have been mixed."
5451,m9vvkfRx_Mc.mp4,"So while the world the word is still sort of waiting, you know to see what that what the actual benefits are."
5452,m9vvkfRx_Mc.mp4,It's interesting that they've already been approved and can continue basically reaping in those rewards also important to note that the Solider the solidarity trial was not included in the fda's decision to approve from dathomir.
5453,m9vvkfRx_Mc.mp4,"All right, I'll just come loaded with all the latest going on on the coronavirus Anjali."
5454,m9vvkfRx_Mc.mp4,Have a great week.

5463,XtQbu0g_Drs.mp4,"Tonight the u.s. Is on the brink of 200,000 deaths from covid-19."
5464,XtQbu0g_Drs.mp4,And there have been more than six point eight million infections.
5465,XtQbu0g_Drs.mp4,And there's news on Wall Street today the stock sell-off continued over concerns of coronavirus and the economy the Dow dropped one point eight percent the S&P 500 lost about one point two percent plus the CDC took an unusual step backtracking on its new guidance about how the virus spreads your cbs's Malanga.Confusion tonight from the CDC after official guidance posted Friday said Airborne transmission is the primary way.
5466,XtQbu0g_Drs.mp4,"The virus is spread and there is growing evidence that droplets and Airborne particles can remain suspended in the air and be breathed in by others and travel distances Beyond six feet, but in a sudden reversal today the CDC removed at guidance saying in an email to CBS News, when asked why the bottom line is Airborne transmission is possible, but notOut the main way that it spreads."
5467,XtQbu0g_Drs.mp4,It may not be the main way it spreads but there's good evidence that the virus can spread through the air under certain circumstances at distances greater than 6 feet.
5468,XtQbu0g_Drs.mp4,"Meanwhile the bells at the National Cathedral told 200 times on Sunday as the u.s. Nears 200,000 lives lost to the virus including Rebecca Loopers Father Fred."
5469,XtQbu0g_Drs.mp4,I held his hand and I told him I loved him and I put my head on his chest and my mom was there.

5472,XtQbu0g_Drs.mp4,It's been months since the CDC or White House coronavirus task force have briefed the American public but Health officials still stress keep wearing your masks and keep social distancing Nora.
5473,XtQbu0g_Drs.mp4,Important to remember that malenky.
5474,XtQbu0g_Drs.mp4,Thank you.
5475,dKcZG8dR0Ng.mp4,Welcome back to the final round the Trump Administration unveiling its plan to distribute a coronavirus that compact seen as quickly as possible and also its goal that no one will have to pay out of pocket for a vaccine Anjali Kalani joins us now with the latest on this Anjali.
5476,dKcZG8dR0Ng.mp4,Thanks Shauna as you've laid out the news of the day is that we are hearing from the Trump Administration both with a playbook for how vaccines will be distributed throughout the nation as well as state by state and Community by community.You with a focus on some of the minority communities as well as tribal Nations.
5477,dKcZG8dR0Ng.mp4,So a really robust sort of really lay out that we got finally today to look at where exactly will go.
5478,dKcZG8dR0Ng.mp4,We know we heard from the administration and operation warp speed over time that they're going to be really focused on priority when we first get that approval and where that approval comes in is still up in the air that we have heard from some companies that late October the early still get an efficacy.
5479,dKcZG8dR0Ng.mp4,Any indication and be able to then apply for that emergency you thought you saw authorization.
5480,dKcZG8dR0Ng.mp4,It looks more likely that that is going to happen based on many reports today as well as an update from operation warp speed itself talking about how there will be distribution through McKesson as we've come to understand as well as through the dod involvement and that really is a widespread already existing relationship with the CDC.
5481,dKcZG8dR0Ng.mp4,Hasn't already distributes us somewhere in the ballpark of 80 million doses of vaccines per year.
5482,dKcZG8dR0Ng.mp4,And that contract can scale up to 900 million if needed some of the things to consider really our age as well as the fact that many of these vaccines are two dose vaccine.
5483,dKcZG8dR0Ng.mp4,"So really looking at how to make sure that any individual getting the vaccine of one company follows up with that booster of the exact same company because a lot more, you know, really is unknown there."
5484,dKcZG8dR0Ng.mp4,And when will this all happen?
5485,dKcZG8dR0Ng.mp4,Right.
5486,dKcZG8dR0Ng.mp4,So the document looks at January 2021 as widespread rollout.
5487,dKcZG8dR0Ng.mp4,We've heard from other officials that April 20-21 is when you know widespread use will be in place but others have said that it could take a little bit longer it could take well into mid 2021 or later even before life returns to normal Shawna and the timeline for that seems to still be all over the place.
5488,i4SZ8AezUgs.mp4,So this is a once-in-a-lifetime event perhaps once in a century event something we've never faced before and the sectors of the economy that are most vulnerable and are going to be disrupted the most are those that have haven't had much disruption for the last fifty or a hundred years and that is health care and higher education in the healthcare.
5489,i4SZ8AezUgs.mp4,We already seeing it.
5490,i4SZ8AezUgs.mp4,"But in higher education, we are yet to feel how this is going to fundamentally alter.of the way we do business and part of the reason the disruption is happening is because we have built systems which are not adaptable or resilient we have Taught educated people the same way for hundreds of years and to do that."
5491,i4SZ8AezUgs.mp4,We have built an infrastructure and a business model which has very high operating leverage of fixed costs.
5492,i4SZ8AezUgs.mp4,These facilities infrastructure faculty are dedicated faculty along functional lines along disciplines.
5493,i4SZ8AezUgs.mp4,And so they are not very adaptable to changing circumstances.
5494,i4SZ8AezUgs.mp4,And so all of a sudden one big change is going to be The rise of online education many faculty have never dealt with that.
5495,i4SZ8AezUgs.mp4,There's going to be also changes in what kind of education is offered over the next decade because the demand for certain disciplines is going to decline for other disciplines is going to increase so it's going to be very important for universities to be more flexible and adaptable and the way they in the way they deploy resources.
5496,i4SZ8AezUgs.mp4,And so this is It's a sea change.
5497,i4SZ8AezUgs.mp4,"It's something we have never experienced before and hopefully we never experience again, but what has it has done as exposed our big vulnerability which is very very high operating leverage."
5498,i4SZ8AezUgs.mp4,Lots of fixed assets.
5499,i4SZ8AezUgs.mp4,"If you look at a university, we have lots of buildings."
5500,i4SZ8AezUgs.mp4,We have Parking Services.
5501,i4SZ8AezUgs.mp4,We have administrative support.
5502,i4SZ8AezUgs.mp4,We have residential dining halls and dorms.
5503,i4SZ8AezUgs.mp4,We have student organizations.
5504,i4SZ8AezUgs.mp4,All these are ancillary to the educational system.
5505,i4SZ8AezUgs.mp4,But consume a lot of resources and what will happen if we go online where we don't have students on campus or we have fewer students on campus.
5506,i4SZ8AezUgs.mp4,Our facilities are not scalable.
5507,i4SZ8AezUgs.mp4,And so this is a challenge that every University is going to face and I think the ones that will do best are the ones who are head and developing systems that are more resilient and adaptable.
5508,i4SZ8AezUgs.mp4,I'm very optimistic.
5509,i4SZ8AezUgs.mp4,I'm very optimistic because we have an amazing group of Faculty.
5510,i4SZ8AezUgs.mp4,So If you think about what is I really most important.
5511,i4SZ8AezUgs.mp4,"Capital in a university it is expertise that faculty have and it's the soft Capital which doesn't show up on your accounting statements, but that's the most critical fat capital and that we have and what we have to do is how do we deploy it?"
5512,i4SZ8AezUgs.mp4,How do we leverage it?
5513,i4SZ8AezUgs.mp4,And how do we deliver it for a much better student experience and that's what is going to be challenging.
5514,i4SZ8AezUgs.mp4,But I'm very optimistic that we have the resources that we can execute.
5515,JX1oEo4gWEI.mp4,"chronic, chronically ill children potentially high-risk for more advanced disease some of the group's we've thought about our kids with chronic respiratory disease chronic pulmonary disease severe asthma for instance interstitial lung disease kids that have tracheostomy or ventilator dependence cystic fibrosis other chronic, lung disease is certain types of congenital heart disease patients with Severe neurologic disease including muscle disease duchenne muscular dystrophy, especially our boys that are wheelchair-bound and then patients obviously under gate undergoing cancer treatment chemotherapy who have compromised immune systems patients with other inflammatory disease disorders taking immune suppressive medications."
5516,JX1oEo4gWEI.mp4,There's a number of groups that were thinking about how should we be approaching the care of those patients in our practices around the country and other two groups had a kid.
5517,JX1oEo4gWEI.mp4,Dialysis or kids who have transplant recipients.
5518,JX1oEo4gWEI.mp4,So it's good point hands plans or bone marrow transplant patients would also be on the higher risk category.
5519,JX1oEo4gWEI.mp4,"Those all those children do fit into the high-risk category of people who are at higher risk for having more severe disease with this pathogen and so they're not really called out in any of the recommendations, but because most are focused on adults but children would fall into that category to in terms of if they do have underlying chronic medical conditions or if there are immunocompromised and so first I would say Say all those patients and their families right now should start practicing good social distance a measure."
5520,JX1oEo4gWEI.mp4,That's really just to protect yourself.
5521,JX1oEo4gWEI.mp4,We are we're advising that to four people older over a certain age as well.
5522,JX1oEo4gWEI.mp4,"You know, the recommendations of people than 60 should think about those things."
5523,JX1oEo4gWEI.mp4,But particularly if you're over 70 where the mortality rate goes up very high after that age group.
5524,JX1oEo4gWEI.mp4,"And so in order to protect your children, first of all, that's the one thing you should be thinking about in terms of what are you doing every day and Try to limit the exposure would be number."
5525,JX1oEo4gWEI.mp4,One thing to do.
5526,JX1oEo4gWEI.mp4,The second thing again.
5527,JX1oEo4gWEI.mp4,"Same advice is to normal healthy kids is that if your kid is only mildly ill they don't need to be seen and actually being seen, you know, if you come to the ER we have lots of sick kids in our ER and we want to keep those that don't need to be there out of there and particularly kids who are at risk for if they were to catch something to be sicker."
5528,JX1oEo4gWEI.mp4,"So again, if you're just mildly ill that's a phone."
5529,JX1oEo4gWEI.mp4,Talk to your provider or your specialist to talk it over with them and make sure they agree that you're safe to be at home and foremost the kids that will be the case and one other thing that we've really emphasized is proactively reaching out to families making sure that they have their medications refilled making sure that they have enough equipment at home.
5530,pIzNAgiBETM.mp4,Assumed I just had the flu.
5531,pIzNAgiBETM.mp4,I'm from a rural area in test Cross County to be the very first patient to pick it up in it and account evens rule as we are.
5532,pIzNAgiBETM.mp4,I don't know how it happened.
5533,pIzNAgiBETM.mp4,I was on full life support.
5534,pIzNAgiBETM.mp4,So I had a ventilator there was a time during this process with Hospital reached out to my wife had to have the discussion about end of life options.
5535,pIzNAgiBETM.mp4,"Then at the bottom, you know, they wrote we will get you home."
5536,pIzNAgiBETM.mp4,I don't know that I've ever seen such selfless people in my life.
5537,pIzNAgiBETM.mp4,I really saw the love of God through these people.
5538,pIzNAgiBETM.mp4,"Just the ability to get back to the point where I can pick up my two little girls hug them and you know of my wife, I feel like I've got a second chance at life."
5539,Gu52tFllR8I.mp4,"So the United Nations says that there is a high prevalence of mental distress worldwide because of the coronavirus pandemic especially amongst healthcare workers as you would expect and children as well which is you know, not surprising we're going to talk to dr. Daniel bober your psychiatrist doctor and you said that the second wave of the pandemic is already here and you're not talking about the coronavirus pandemic."
5540,Gu52tFllR8I.mp4,You're talking about a mental health pandemic.
5541,Gu52tFllR8I.mp4,What are you Seeing with some of your patients.
5542,Gu52tFllR8I.mp4,"Well, you know if covid-19 is anything it's a disease of loneliness, right?"
5543,Gu52tFllR8I.mp4,It's a disease of isolation.
5544,Gu52tFllR8I.mp4,So you have health care workers who are being isolated from their family or friends because they're afraid of cashing it from them.
5545,Gu52tFllR8I.mp4,You have patients dying alone also isolated.
5546,Gu52tFllR8I.mp4,So it's really the loneliness that makes this disease so cool.
5547,Gu52tFllR8I.mp4,"But what I'm seeing in my own patients is an increase in depression anxiety insomnia, and maybe if they were using a glass of wine to take the edge off now they're using a whole bottle."
5548,Gu52tFllR8I.mp4,So it's Definitely something that's impacted them pretty hard.
5549,Gu52tFllR8I.mp4,And doctor though.
5550,Gu52tFllR8I.mp4,I'm very curious because in my mind and I as a Layman I would imagine that it's not just one thing.
5551,Gu52tFllR8I.mp4,"There are multiple factors that will affect the mental health of people in this country, especially this year in 2020."
5552,Gu52tFllR8I.mp4,"For example, you're talking about the protest that we've seen in the streets and yes, perhaps they were sparked by the killing of mr. Floyd and others."
5553,Gu52tFllR8I.mp4,"Certainly, but for a lot of people."
5554,Gu52tFllR8I.mp4,This has been an ongoing stress to their well-being that most people have had since the day they were born since the day they came into this world being born black they've dealt with the pressure and the stress of all that encompasses on top of that you now have this pandemic which is disproportionately affected a black people and now you've got the protest and you see the violence that is happening in the street.
5555,Gu52tFllR8I.mp4,"And finally, you're going to worry about whether people who are out there protesting are going to get sick."
5556,Gu52tFllR8I.mp4,If they didn't get sick the first time around.
5557,Gu52tFllR8I.mp4,Are they going to get sick this time around right?
5558,Gu52tFllR8I.mp4,And ironically the people that are most affected are also the minorities in the African-American communities.
5559,Gu52tFllR8I.mp4,So it's the perfect storm.
5560,Gu52tFllR8I.mp4,It's a Confluence of factors and there's also the economic despair.
5561,Gu52tFllR8I.mp4,So you've got all these moving parts coming together to create a catastrophic situation.
5562,Gu52tFllR8I.mp4,So how would you say that mental health issues have sort of changed as a result of the pandemic.
5563,Gu52tFllR8I.mp4,I remember sort of very early on when everything was shut down and it was completely sort of unfathomable to many many people that we would certainly for us lad like you would be able to work from home and a profession like this.
5564,Gu52tFllR8I.mp4,There was this sense that a change was afoot and we didn't know really what that was.
5565,Gu52tFllR8I.mp4,Now this sort of change is starting to feel normal.
5566,Gu52tFllR8I.mp4,But I think there's still a certain level of uncertainty and a lack of confidence in institutions that we once felt we could depend on what do you think of some of the underlying thing that's leading to people having you know as perhaps a mental health crisis.
5567,Gu52tFllR8I.mp4,"Well, I think there's a mistrust in the system."
5568,Gu52tFllR8I.mp4,"And unfortunately, the virus has become politicized and I tell people all the time."
5569,Gu52tFllR8I.mp4,This is not about ideology.
5570,Gu52tFllR8I.mp4,It's about biology.
5571,Gu52tFllR8I.mp4,It's not about politics.
5572,Gu52tFllR8I.mp4,It's about public health.
5573,Gu52tFllR8I.mp4,And so we need to be supportive of each other and we need to restore faith in institutions and I think because there's been a lot of misinformation and there's been a lot of confounding factors that people have lost faith in those systems to support them.
5574,Gu52tFllR8I.mp4,"All right, dr. Bowen."
5575,Gu52tFllR8I.mp4,Thank you very much.
5576,Gu52tFllR8I.mp4,As always.
5577,Gu52tFllR8I.mp4,We appreciate your time and your Insight really really a pleasure.
5578,Gu52tFllR8I.mp4,Glad to thank you.
5579,Gu52tFllR8I.mp4,Take care now.
5580,m7DvF13QBvA.mp4,contact tracing this word is very popular these days why this contact tracing it extremely important to identify covid-19 infected individuals.
5581,m7DvF13QBvA.mp4,"First of all, what is this contact tracing and why it is important."
5582,m7DvF13QBvA.mp4,Everyone need to understand this clearly.
5583,m7DvF13QBvA.mp4,People who are in close contact with someone who is infected with the virus such as the coronavirus that is Noble Cove to are at higher risk of becoming infected themselves and of potentially further infecting others.
5584,m7DvF13QBvA.mp4,So closely watching these contacts after exposure to an infected person will help the contact to get care and treatment and also will prevent further transmission of the virus and this monitoring process is called Contact tracing and this contact tracing which has been broken down into three basic steps in that.
5585,m7DvF13QBvA.mp4,The first one is called as contact identification.
5586,m7DvF13QBvA.mp4,So what is the contact identification here?
5587,m7DvF13QBvA.mp4,Once someone is confirmed as infected with the virus contacts or identified by asking about the person's activities and roles of the people around them since onset of the illness.
5588,m7DvF13QBvA.mp4,Then these contacts can be anyone who has been in contact with the infected person may be family members work colleagues friends or healthcare providers.
5589,m7DvF13QBvA.mp4,Second basic process is called as a contact listing.
5590,m7DvF13QBvA.mp4,All persons considered to have contact with an infected person should be listed as contacts and effort should be made to identify every listed contact to inform them of their contact status what it means and the actions that will follow and the importance of receiving early care if they develop symptoms.
5591,m7DvF13QBvA.mp4,Contact should also be provided with information about the prevention of the disease in some cases quarantine or isolation is required for high-risk contacts either at home or in the hospital and the third basic step is called as the contact follow-up.
5592,m7DvF13QBvA.mp4,So regular follow-up should be conducted with all contacts to monitor for symptoms and test for signs of infection.
5593,m7DvF13QBvA.mp4,This is the importance of contact tracing.
5594,_yCQzLNDyeM.mp4,What is contact tracing contact tracing is a vital way to stop the spread of deadly infectious diseases from Ebola to covid-19 across Massachusetts PIH is supporting patients and warning their contacts of exposure to the virus.
5595,_yCQzLNDyeM.mp4,Our model has since been replicated across other states.
5596,_yCQzLNDyeM.mp4,Here's how it works.
5597,_yCQzLNDyeM.mp4,When a patient test positive that person becomes the index case a contact Tracer calls his patient to learn who else may have been exposed.
5598,_yCQzLNDyeM.mp4,Then the contact Tracer calls.
5599,_yCQzLNDyeM.mp4,The index case has contacts family members neighbors colleagues and virtually screens them for symptoms of the disease.
5600,_yCQzLNDyeM.mp4,It's contact show symptoms.
5601,_yCQzLNDyeM.mp4,They become suspected cases and are asked to quarantine.
5602,_yCQzLNDyeM.mp4,If they later test positive their contacts will be called and the process repeats.
5603,_yCQzLNDyeM.mp4,"If contacts don't show symptoms, they will still be monitored during the disease's incubation period for covid-19 that period is 14 days."
5604,_yCQzLNDyeM.mp4,"This process will continue until all cases are identified allowing us to track the virus test treat and isolate patients and stop the spread, but we need your help."

5606,Imz6M1-X11U.mp4,"Hi, I'm dr. Gerald early and welcome to the ongoing series spread the facts not the virus one question is why do some people get very sick with covid-19 and others do not we've all heard of people testing positive for covid-19 who recovered home with few symptoms and have no lasting effects While others get very A thick and are hospitalized and overall about three percent of people will die many times more than with influenza."
5607,Imz6M1-X11U.mp4,There are some known risk factors for a bad outcome.
5608,Imz6M1-X11U.mp4,"They include H. Statistically the older you are the more likely you are to have decreased ability to fight the infection, but we know of people over 90 who have recovered also other medical conditions some of which we may not know about before we get sick can make us more susceptible."
5609,Imz6M1-X11U.mp4,"However, young people including those in their twenties teens and younger can get he's very sick from covid-19 the nature of covid-19."
5610,Imz6M1-X11U.mp4,The disease caused by the new coronavirus can and does dramatically impact People's Health and for some survivors that their life is never the same.
5611,Imz6M1-X11U.mp4,You may remember hearing about Broadway star Nick Cordero who died in July after a long battle with the coronavirus.
5612,Imz6M1-X11U.mp4,He was 41.
5613,Imz6M1-X11U.mp4,He spent 90 days in the hospital had his leg amputated.
5614,Imz6M1-X11U.mp4,"Due to blood clots and was being considered for a lung transplant because of the damage the disease did to his lungs or maybe you've heard about children in Washington, Idaho and other places who are profoundly sick and some of whom died from the disease."
5615,Imz6M1-X11U.mp4,So what causes this variability?
5616,Imz6M1-X11U.mp4,Why do some people do find and some do awful?
5617,Imz6M1-X11U.mp4,There are internal things that impact how your body responds to this disease they included Dancing age and coexisting diseases like diabetes high blood pressure and obesity.
5618,Imz6M1-X11U.mp4,But in addition how your body responds to the infection is a poorly understood but very important determinant of what happens to you how your body fights the infection that is your immune response matters a lot.
5619,Imz6M1-X11U.mp4,If your immune response is too weak.
5620,Imz6M1-X11U.mp4,You are more likely to not do well.
5621,Imz6M1-X11U.mp4,"But also if you're immune response is too strong, you'll not do well undefined inherited factors prior exposure to another coronavirus and things."
5622,Imz6M1-X11U.mp4,We don't know Define how we respond to the infection and they determine what happens to us many of these you can't control and that's part of what makes this disease so scary but it's also part of the reason why it's so important and not get the disease this time do everything you can to avoid getting covid-19 wear a mask practice physical distancing and do careful hand cleansing.
5623,Imz6M1-X11U.mp4,We're all worn out by this but we will Outlast this remember that the worst thing that has happened is not the last thing that will happen you we will make it through this and we will will rebuild grow and flourish.
5624,Imz6M1-X11U.mp4,"Once again, thank you for tuning in."
5625,amQpyk3yrtI.mp4,"So I'm not going into work tomorrow, but and there's his how she's been for the past 14 days after testing positive for covid-19."
5626,amQpyk3yrtI.mp4,This is J5 after being exposed on a Tuesday.
5627,amQpyk3yrtI.mp4,It's Sunday and I have coronavirus Kim caught covid after inviting a friend over for dinner.
5628,amQpyk3yrtI.mp4,They ate Outdoors to be safer.
5629,amQpyk3yrtI.mp4,But sack closer than the recommended six feet.
5630,amQpyk3yrtI.mp4,It just took one person.
5631,amQpyk3yrtI.mp4,"I invited the virus over to my House, I drank wine with the virus the next day her friend has two positive."
5632,amQpyk3yrtI.mp4,I got the phone call from her and it was like really scary actually learning that like I had been exposed to somebody who had it and then you just kind of knew at least I kind of knew like I'm about to get it because we were together way too long.
5633,amQpyk3yrtI.mp4,We weren't social distancing we weren't wearing masks Kim acted fast immediately self quarantining at home monitoring herself for symptoms a few days later she to tested And you don't know how your body's going to react like is it going to be a very severe case?
5634,amQpyk3yrtI.mp4,Is it going to be mild?
5635,amQpyk3yrtI.mp4,"Am I going to be asymptomatic Kim experience mild symptoms her husband, Kevin also got sick and together."
5636,amQpyk3yrtI.mp4,They quarantined at home as they recovered.
5637,amQpyk3yrtI.mp4,Their infections are part of a growing Trend with the virus spreading more in younger people in recent months our CDC report finds.
5638,amQpyk3yrtI.mp4,"The number of new cases was highest in those ages 20 to 29 between June and August like the majority of people in their 20s, Kim and Kevin."
5639,amQpyk3yrtI.mp4,Didn't require hospitalization local Force.
5640,amQpyk3yrtI.mp4,Dr. Frank McGeorge cautions while their experience is typical age is no guarantee.
5641,amQpyk3yrtI.mp4,"Most younger people do experience milder illness older people people over 50 65, for example, they tend to have more severe consequences."
5642,amQpyk3yrtI.mp4,"But, you know even among young people we can't predict who is going to go basically less scathe through unscathed and who's going to have more severe illness."
5643,amQpyk3yrtI.mp4,Kim is grateful.
5644,amQpyk3yrtI.mp4,She had not seen her parents or grandparents or anyone in higher risk after she was exposed.
5645,amQpyk3yrtI.mp4,I've just felt grateful that I got through it and it was fairly easy for me for biggest lesson learned.
5646,amQpyk3yrtI.mp4,It only takes a moment of relax precautions to put yourself at risk.
5647,amQpyk3yrtI.mp4,I think the moral of the story he is from my experience.
5648,amQpyk3yrtI.mp4,You can think you're doing the right thing.
5649,amQpyk3yrtI.mp4,I'm outside.
5650,amQpyk3yrtI.mp4,"I'm you know, socially distant but the truth is is it only takes one person."
5651,amQpyk3yrtI.mp4,Dr. McGeorge agrees really to make sure that you reduce your risk as much as possible.
5652,amQpyk3yrtI.mp4,You need to reduce contact as much as possible.
5653,amQpyk3yrtI.mp4,"So, you know, even when you're in the proximity of someone else that might be infected at this point, we should frankly assume that anyone could be infected if you're just in their proximity you could become infected."
5654,2PFT4KHWsWQ.mp4,"Oh, hey, so if you haven't heard the province is now asking all albertans to get tested for covid-19 regardless of whether you have symptoms or not."
5655,2PFT4KHWsWQ.mp4,You see because not everyone who has covid-19 actually shows symptoms.
5656,2PFT4KHWsWQ.mp4,The more of us who get tested the better idea the Alberta Government and Alberta Health Services has on just how widespread this disease actually is and then they can take that information and help better plan to support Alberta as it continues to reopen the first thing you have to do is Is book an appointment and it's a super easy process.
5657,2PFT4KHWsWQ.mp4,So first you want to go to AHS dot see a forward slash covid and then click on the testing link launch the self-assessment.
5658,2PFT4KHWsWQ.mp4,And then if you have no symptoms just answer no until you get to the question that I asked you whether or not you want to take part in asymptomatic testing.
5659,2PFT4KHWsWQ.mp4,You're going to want to say.
5660,2PFT4KHWsWQ.mp4,Yes.
5661,2PFT4KHWsWQ.mp4,You're then going to be asked for some minor information on a secure page before getting some options for appointment times that quick aside here.
5662,2PFT4KHWsWQ.mp4,If you actually do have symptoms for covid-19 answer.
5663,2PFT4KHWsWQ.mp4,"Yes, you're still going to be given an opportunity to book your appointment online."
5664,2PFT4KHWsWQ.mp4,Once you've picked your time and location.
5665,2PFT4KHWsWQ.mp4,Just confirm your booking.
5666,2PFT4KHWsWQ.mp4,And you're done see too easy.
5667,2PFT4KHWsWQ.mp4,"All right, so it's the day of my appointment and I'm here at the assessment center."
5668,2PFT4KHWsWQ.mp4,And some people might be wondering is could there possibly be someone else here waiting to be tested who is in fact covid-19 positive and the truth of the matter is yeah there could be but don't worry HS has got you covered because they put in significant infection prevention and control measures that are designed to keep you and your family safe.
5669,2PFT4KHWsWQ.mp4,Sure am.
5670,2PFT4KHWsWQ.mp4,Awesome.
5671,2PFT4KHWsWQ.mp4,Thank you very much.
5672,2PFT4KHWsWQ.mp4,So when it's your turn to be tested couple things that you need to know when the registered nurse comes to greet you they're going to ask you a few questions.
5673,2PFT4KHWsWQ.mp4,They're also going to ask to see your ID both your picture ID as well as your Alberta Health Care cards to remember to bring those good.
5674,2PFT4KHWsWQ.mp4,How about yourself?
5675,2PFT4KHWsWQ.mp4,I think so.
5676,2PFT4KHWsWQ.mp4,So this is a fruit talk.
5677,2PFT4KHWsWQ.mp4,I'm going to be swabbing both sides of your throat and the back of your throat.
5678,2PFT4KHWsWQ.mp4,It may make your eyes water clock or k if you can't handle it you can put your hand up and I'll stop and you can when you're ready I can redo it.
5679,2PFT4KHWsWQ.mp4,"Okay, that's the swab."
5680,2PFT4KHWsWQ.mp4,Yes.
5681,2PFT4KHWsWQ.mp4,I can say after me.
5682,2PFT4KHWsWQ.mp4,That's it.
5683,2PFT4KHWsWQ.mp4,That is it.
5684,2PFT4KHWsWQ.mp4,I'll do better off this way.
5685,2PFT4KHWsWQ.mp4,He sent off and you'll get your results in 125 days.

5739,JRGJ5m3VHXo.mp4,The first of which is setting a schedule and following routine having a fixed wake up time daily is the most important part ofSchedule a bedtime routine should also be followed you should wind down and have wind down time without technology in the hours leading to bedtime try to avoid anything back lit like a phone a tablet or computer your brain thinks that the light coming from those is daylight and it will suppress the release of a hormone called melatonin which helps put you to sleep.

5741,JRGJ5m3VHXo.mp4,What we're trying to do is establish a connection between the bed and sleep the bed is only for sleep and intimacy the bed is not for eating or working or reading or pretty much anything else if you get in bed and you can't fall asleep within 20 minutes without watching the clock get out of bed do something boring like a Sudoku or Light reading in low-light.
5742,JRGJ5m3VHXo.mp4,Go back to bed only when you're sleepy not just bored try to avoid napping as this eats up.
5743,JRGJ5m3VHXo.mp4,You're 24 hours sleep requirement.

5749,egLiksDSPWE.mp4,Drug companies around the world are racing to develop the first vaccine for covid-19.
5750,egLiksDSPWE.mp4,And today nine of them signed an unusual pledge promising to uphold High ethical standards for testing.
5751,egLiksDSPWE.mp4,So to discuss that with us is dr. Helen Boucher chief of the division of geographic medicine and infectious diseases at Tufts Medical Center.
5752,egLiksDSPWE.mp4,Good to see you good to see you Emily.
5753,egLiksDSPWE.mp4,"So as an infectious disease expert can you explain why it is so critical why this pledge matters and why it's critical for the public to trust this process.Well Emily as Physicians our first duty is to be truthful with our patients and in terms of thinking about vaccines, especially these are medicines that are going to be used on healthy people and I think we've talked a little about this before we need to be extra sure that the safety and Effectiveness are tested in the most robust way possible before they're deemed safe by the FDA."
5754,egLiksDSPWE.mp4,And before we recommend them to our patients so very very important that the process is trustworthy.
5755,egLiksDSPWE.mp4,"All right, let's talk about people you mentioned that there theInstitutes of Health now sponsoring tv ads to recruit more minorities to participate in some of these clinical trials why is diversity important when we're testing these vaccines do we think the drug could work differently in different demographic groups?"
5756,egLiksDSPWE.mp4,"Well, it's possible and we talked about special populations when we test new medicines and it's very important that those populations older people younger people people of different race and ethnicity are included so that we know that the medicine acts in the same way and that it's safe and effective."
5757,egLiksDSPWE.mp4,Even those groups it's also important because we all just out of human nature want to take something that we know works and people like us through good point.
5758,egLiksDSPWE.mp4,Alright this finally caught our eye today and international team of experts on food contamination.
5759,egLiksDSPWE.mp4,Now saying that it's very unlikely that food is a source of covid-19 transmission.
5760,egLiksDSPWE.mp4,So food packaging food handling all of that is very low risk.
5761,egLiksDSPWE.mp4,Where do you think the dangers are at this point in terms of surface transmission?
5762,egLiksDSPWE.mp4,"Well, the good news Emily is that there hasn't yet been a case that's been linked to any kind of surface transmission."
5763,egLiksDSPWE.mp4,And I think we need to double down on those things that protect everyone which is minimizing close contact washing our hands frequently covering our face when we're together and avoiding crowded situations.
5764,egLiksDSPWE.mp4,"I think, you know wiping down those frequently touch surfaces is still a good idea in case anyone were to sneeze and cough on such a surface."
5765,egLiksDSPWE.mp4,But really this news about food is just more good news in that.
5766,egLiksDSPWE.mp4,It really does not seem that surfaces.
5767,egLiksDSPWE.mp4,"As big of a problem as we thought several months ago, right and we could use all the good news we can get I think when it comes to this, okay, dr. Boucher."
5768,egLiksDSPWE.mp4,Thank you for your time.
5769,egLiksDSPWE.mp4,We appreciate it.
5770,egLiksDSPWE.mp4,Thank you.
5771,Ca7lWoSDkKY.mp4,"Hey guys, what are you doing?"
5772,Ca7lWoSDkKY.mp4,I'm playing Carnegie for these kids and two million others in Ontario's publicly funded schools a day of big news publicly funded schools will remain closed until May 4th.
5773,Ca7lWoSDkKY.mp4,We're taking the next steps to provide continued learning for our children by unveiling a new teacher LED program.
5774,Ca7lWoSDkKY.mp4,When you finish the multiplication some of it long overdue if you ask someone tear your parents what I found most frustrating is when this first started theSend out their phase one plan and it was really an on plan.
5775,Ca7lWoSDkKY.mp4,They sent out a bunch of links and they effectively turned us all into teachers.
5776,Ca7lWoSDkKY.mp4,"But in another Province a different reaction Alberta waited longer to close it schools, but once it did parents received a distance learning plan this mother of two calls realistic."
5777,Ca7lWoSDkKY.mp4,All they decided to do was have at least five hours of works for the kids to do over the course of the week.
5778,Ca7lWoSDkKY.mp4,So about an hour a day.
5779,Ca7lWoSDkKY.mp4,It's not really marked or graded but the teachers are helping and they're sending home Corrections.
5780,Ca7lWoSDkKY.mp4,Alberta schools are closed indefinitely for other provinces and one territory have announced the same plan including Manitoba earlier today.
5781,Ca7lWoSDkKY.mp4,Manitoba's K-12 schools will have their in school classes suspended indefinitely for this school year when you are learning new Concepts and you will up until now teachers in that Province were told to keep students engaged in learning activities like watching Batteries for some saying hi was important for other reasons.
5782,Ca7lWoSDkKY.mp4,It's his time to really check in with our kids and not ask.
5783,Ca7lWoSDkKY.mp4,Hey.
5784,Ca7lWoSDkKY.mp4,How's your homework going?
5785,Ca7lWoSDkKY.mp4,"But just ask hey, how are you doing?"
5786,Ca7lWoSDkKY.mp4,Are you functioning?
5787,Ca7lWoSDkKY.mp4,Are you talking to people maintaining a sense of normalcy for students is a goal shared by Educators across Canada most provinces also made a commitment that students will move on to the next grade or graduate.

5790,yuXzAh4slNw.mp4,"When a patient is diagnosed with an infectious disease, like covid-19 an important step in slowing the transmission of the disease is contact tracing contact tracing seeks to identify the people who have had close contact with the infected individual and who therefore may be infected themselves."
5791,yuXzAh4slNw.mp4,This targeted strategy reduces the need for stay-at-home periods.
5792,yuXzAh4slNw.mp4,"However, manual contact tracing is subject to a person's ability to recall every one."
5793,yuXzAh4slNw.mp4,They have come in contact with over.A two-week period there is need for an automated privacy-preserving contact tracing system.
5794,yuXzAh4slNw.mp4,MIT is developing one such system.
5795,yuXzAh4slNw.mp4,Cell phones are constantly advertising their presence using Bluetooth.
5796,yuXzAh4slNw.mp4,These advertisements which we call chirps can be anonymous and contain no location data or personally identifiable information.
5797,yuXzAh4slNw.mp4,Every phone stores a list of all the chirps that it has sent and all the chirps and has overheard from nearby phones within Arm's Reach.
5798,yuXzAh4slNw.mp4,The MIT system utilizes these lists to enable contact tracing for people diagnosed with covid-19.
5799,yuXzAh4slNw.mp4,This system not only identifies contacts.
5800,yuXzAh4slNw.mp4,It also estimates the distance between individuals as well as the amount of time they spent in close proximity to each other.
5801,yuXzAh4slNw.mp4,When a person is diagnosed with covid-19 public health professionals would coordinate with the patient to upload the list of chirps sent out by their phone to a public database.
5802,yuXzAh4slNw.mp4,Meanwhile people who have not been diagnosed and have their phones do a daily scan of the public database to see if their phones have overheard any of the chirps used by people later diagnosed with covid-19.
5803,yuXzAh4slNw.mp4,This indicates that they were in close prolonged contact with that Anonymous individual depending on the circumstances of contact.
5804,yuXzAh4slNw.mp4,"They may be referred to the public health authorities who may recommend varying courses of action, including symptom watch testing and self quarantine."
5805,9csvnEpeSrI.mp4,Social distancing social distancing social distancing and social house.
5806,9csvnEpeSrI.mp4,Yes.
5807,9csvnEpeSrI.mp4,Social distancing or more accurately physical distancing everyone is mentioning it.
5808,9csvnEpeSrI.mp4,But why is it so vital?
5809,9csvnEpeSrI.mp4,Let's walk through it together take this one dot I dot dot has covid-19.
5810,9csvnEpeSrI.mp4,Sorry dot dot doesn't know they have covid-19.
5811,9csvnEpeSrI.mp4,They don't even feel that sick.
5812,9csvnEpeSrI.mp4,"Why worry, let's follow dot on a typical day."
5813,9csvnEpeSrI.mp4,They take the bus to work grab coffee at that.
5814,9csvnEpeSrI.mp4,Favorite Cafe.
5815,9csvnEpeSrI.mp4,Go to lunch with the friend touching the menu the silver.
5816,9csvnEpeSrI.mp4,The food you get the picture by also touching these objects or interacting with thought other dots could get covid-19.
5817,9csvnEpeSrI.mp4,Now imagine this spread across hundreds thousands of dots covid-19 is more serious than the flute with one in five people with covid-19 needing hospitalization.
5818,9csvnEpeSrI.mp4,This means a rapidly spreading virus will quickly overwhelmed our Healthcare System that leaves some of these thoughts who could be your family and friends without the hospital treatment they need Need of course the dots that spread this aren't doing it on purpose.
5819,9csvnEpeSrI.mp4,Some may not even have symptoms yet seems like it's impossible to stop.
5820,9csvnEpeSrI.mp4,It's not there's a solution and it's up to you that solution is physical distancing with physical distancing covid-19 with spread much slower slower spread means less crowded hospitals and more lives saved.
5821,9csvnEpeSrI.mp4,This is what people mean when they say flatten the curb early.
5822,9csvnEpeSrI.mp4,"Use of physical distancing may help explain why the virus spread much slower in Hong Kong compared to places like Italy, unfortunately the cases in Canada and especially the states are rising showing the need for continued action."
5823,9csvnEpeSrI.mp4,"So, how can you help work from home?"
5824,9csvnEpeSrI.mp4,When possible keep your kids at home video chat with your friends make social distancing social.
5825,9csvnEpeSrI.mp4,Some people may ask her.
5826,9csvnEpeSrI.mp4,We overreacting a more important question.
5827,9csvnEpeSrI.mp4,Maybe are you willing to take the vital steps necessary?
5828,9csvnEpeSrI.mp4,Necessary to protect your community which.
5829,9csvnEpeSrI.mp4,Will you be?
5830,tt9PqYkFcVw.mp4,Tell me when when you think we'll have a vaccine as best you can.
5831,tt9PqYkFcVw.mp4,Ready to to administer to the public.
5832,tt9PqYkFcVw.mp4,Dr. Adler.
5833,tt9PqYkFcVw.mp4,"Well, I think it's dr. Cadillac said I think there will be vaccine that initially be available sometime between November and December but very limited Supply and will have to be prioritized if you're asking me when is it going to be generally available to the American public so we can begin to take advantage of vaccine to get back to our regular life?"
5834,tt9PqYkFcVw.mp4,"I think we're are we looking at third late second quarter third quarter 2021 And so you think by the late second and third quarter, we will have started to vaccinate people."
5835,tt9PqYkFcVw.mp4,"I think the vaccination will begin in November December and then we'll pick up you know, and it'll be in a prioritized way those First Responders and those at greatest risk for death and then eventually that will expand, you know, there's about it's hard to believe but there's about 80 million people in our country that have significant comorbidities that put themselves at risk."
5836,tt9PqYkFcVw.mp4,They have to get vaccinated and then the general public but I'm about to run out of time.
5837,tt9PqYkFcVw.mp4,And what do you call this effort?
5838,tt9PqYkFcVw.mp4,This worldwide effort led by the United States of America to develop a vaccine.
5839,tt9PqYkFcVw.mp4,What is the term for it operation warp speed sir.
5840,tt9PqYkFcVw.mp4,Have you ever seen anything like operation warp speed?
5841,tt9PqYkFcVw.mp4,It's unprecedented.
5842,tt9PqYkFcVw.mp4,How long does it usually take?
5843,tt9PqYkFcVw.mp4,This will be my last question.
5844,tt9PqYkFcVw.mp4,Mr. Chairman to develop a vaccine think the fastest prior was two years and usually four to six years.
5845,tt9PqYkFcVw.mp4,Thank you.
5846,tt9PqYkFcVw.mp4,Mr. Chairman.
5847,FMAQvA1dB_Y.mp4,So what exactly does the test for the coronavirus involve we sent denim Hitchcock to a GP to find out he joins me on the desk tonight and good evening to you.
5848,FMAQvA1dB_Y.mp4,I think it's important to show the viewer step-by-step what they might expect if they have to go and get a test.
5849,FMAQvA1dB_Y.mp4,What was the experience like?
5850,FMAQvA1dB_Y.mp4,"Well, you wouldn't do it for kicks on a Friday night put it that way but it's very simple and the interesting thing for me was it takes five days for that test to come back five days, and that means this curve that we keep talking about and we'll discuss again later is 5 days behind."
5851,FMAQvA1dB_Y.mp4,"Behind because that information is not there yet, but that was explained to me by the doctor."
5852,FMAQvA1dB_Y.mp4,I went to see today George quick.
5853,FMAQvA1dB_Y.mp4,Doctor hello denim nice to see it's not secede to please take a seat.
5854,FMAQvA1dB_Y.mp4,So this is the covid swab this will go into your nose into the back of your throat.
5855,FMAQvA1dB_Y.mp4,It's a little bit uncomfortable.
5856,FMAQvA1dB_Y.mp4,So you do one in each nostril.
5857,FMAQvA1dB_Y.mp4,I think you'll agree.
5858,FMAQvA1dB_Y.mp4,That's really unpleasant.
5859,FMAQvA1dB_Y.mp4,You really get in there and just to prove you're enjoying yourself.
5860,FMAQvA1dB_Y.mp4,Give me the other one as well the second one as well.
5861,FMAQvA1dB_Y.mp4,And he is the ideal candidate well.
5862,FMAQvA1dB_Y.mp4,"most people scream and run around the room So of these swabs, yep, you've had around 50 patients and they've all come back negative."
5863,FMAQvA1dB_Y.mp4,"Yes, and what are the labs telling you about the availability of the testing but what point do you think that they might run out?"
5864,FMAQvA1dB_Y.mp4,Are you worried about it?
5865,FMAQvA1dB_Y.mp4,"Well, I've been told that they're running out every test."
5866,FMAQvA1dB_Y.mp4,I've said so far as come back with a result.
5867,FMAQvA1dB_Y.mp4,It takes five days.
5868,FMAQvA1dB_Y.mp4,Dr. A direct question is five days fast enough.
5869,FMAQvA1dB_Y.mp4,"No, I think instant would be fast enough."
5870,FMAQvA1dB_Y.mp4,"It's coming flu season will be Yeah, it'll be impressive."
5871,FMAQvA1dB_Y.mp4,So I've already been busily vaccinating people left and right for the flu not because that will protect them from the coronavirus.
5872,FMAQvA1dB_Y.mp4,But at least it'll protect them and the community from the confusion arising when a person turns up with a fever and a respiratory illness you on the front line.
5873,FMAQvA1dB_Y.mp4,How worried are you I fully expect that.
5874,FMAQvA1dB_Y.mp4,I will meet this virus at some point.
5875,FMAQvA1dB_Y.mp4,I'll catch it and while I'm not particularly worried about dying I figure it's part of life.
5876,FMAQvA1dB_Y.mp4,I'm not sure I'm ready to go yet and I'm aware.
5877,FMAQvA1dB_Y.mp4,We're at my age that the chance that I would dies up there around to 3% There's a very experienced doctor there who's kind of fatalistic about getting this and I should point out that there's plenty of those swabs.
5878,FMAQvA1dB_Y.mp4,But like he said the chemical agent to test those swabs is in short supply.
5879,FMAQvA1dB_Y.mp4,"So obviously my test didn't go anywhere, but that's something they need to look at immediately goes right to the back of the throat."
5880,FMAQvA1dB_Y.mp4,There were not not a comfortable experience.
5881,FMAQvA1dB_Y.mp4,He didn't miss me you go right?
5882,FMAQvA1dB_Y.mp4,I think it's interesting to show our viewers exactly how it works.
5883,FMAQvA1dB_Y.mp4,I mean a little uncomfortable but crucial to test accurately and Very easy.
5884,FMAQvA1dB_Y.mp4,There you go.
5885,FMAQvA1dB_Y.mp4,Alright then.
5886,FMAQvA1dB_Y.mp4,Thanks for that.
5887,sgZ7RKyDrLg.mp4,Many who work in infectious disease new a pandemic like this was coming the really fast moving respiratory pathogen came out we wouldn't be able to hold those numbers down.
5888,sgZ7RKyDrLg.mp4,Could it be a coronavirus again?
5889,sgZ7RKyDrLg.mp4,Certainly?
5890,sgZ7RKyDrLg.mp4,We didn't think it would be able to get into people.
5891,sgZ7RKyDrLg.mp4,It didn't look like it was a clear and present danger unfortunate for a disease to become a pandemic it.I have to find an extraordinary balance.
5892,sgZ7RKyDrLg.mp4,So where does this current pandemic fall?
5893,sgZ7RKyDrLg.mp4,So the most significant diseases often cause symptoms like coughing and fever that could be confused with other diseases.
5894,sgZ7RKyDrLg.mp4,That's what makes this coronavirus.
5895,sgZ7RKyDrLg.mp4,So devious of all the viruses out there.
5896,sgZ7RKyDrLg.mp4,Why did this one end up becoming the kind of pandemic?
5897,sgZ7RKyDrLg.mp4,We haven't seen in more than a century and how does a pandemic like this end?
5898,U_5igBy5L3s.mp4,The amount of time spent getting updates on covid-19 is strongly linked to how anxious and stressed people feel.
5899,U_5igBy5L3s.mp4,However the official use of WhatsApp to disseminate information appeared to reduce people's anxiety.
5900,U_5igBy5L3s.mp4,Now that's according to a recent study by Yale and us on news exposure during the pandemic which has researchers are saying that these findings are encouraging they could Empower government agencies to develop Innovative community.
5901,U_5igBy5L3s.mp4,Location solutions that can perhaps help people cope during this crisis.
5902,U_5igBy5L3s.mp4,The study was conducted with 1145 residents here in Singapore over eight weeks in March and April this year and for more we're joined by lead researcher assistant professor jean-loup professor Liu good evening and welcome good to talk to you this evening.
5903,U_5igBy5L3s.mp4,Now though information-seeking is in college during a pandemic.
5904,U_5igBy5L3s.mp4,"You know, we want you we want more."
5905,U_5igBy5L3s.mp4,Asian but the research has also shown that transparency promotes resilience your study found that the longer someone actually spends doing so the poorer his or her psychological health.
5906,U_5igBy5L3s.mp4,So why is that?
5907,U_5igBy5L3s.mp4,"Yeah, that's a really interesting finding that research groups all over the wall happen reporting some most people spend about half an hour to one hour getting covid-19 updates, but about one in four people spend two hours or more and this seems to predict."
5908,U_5igBy5L3s.mp4,"Poor mental health, there's a couple of reasons why this could happen first as the Lord of covid-19 news and rumors being shat the World Health Organization calls this an info d'emic."
5909,U_5igBy5L3s.mp4,These are largely bad news as you might imagine.
5910,U_5igBy5L3s.mp4,So maybe reading about all these details makes you feel worse on the other hand.
5911,U_5igBy5L3s.mp4,Maybe those people who are already depressed anxious or stress may spend more time reading about covid-19.
5912,U_5igBy5L3s.mp4,So the direction could really go in both directions.
5913,U_5igBy5L3s.mp4,"Were you surprised by the So, you know all that other factors you think could have passed maybe contribute it to what you found."
5914,U_5igBy5L3s.mp4,One thing that mm researchers picking up my paper have asked me is do you think the Citizens Trust in the government makes a difference?
5915,U_5igBy5L3s.mp4,"I think that is definitely a factor that you know, the you know, our primary finding is that over and above news news predicting poor mental health taking updates and predicting poor mental health using a WhatsApp Channel actually mitigate that Ask so yeah, perhaps people's trust in the messaging makes a difference."
5916,U_5igBy5L3s.mp4,"So Professor noon, let's talk a little bit more about that."
5917,U_5igBy5L3s.mp4,What's up that official WhatsApp Channel?
5918,U_5igBy5L3s.mp4,"Because your research found that people trusted that more than traditional news sources, like, you know newspapers television like us and radio."
5919,U_5igBy5L3s.mp4,So can you explain the psychology behind there?
5920,U_5igBy5L3s.mp4,And and what what perhaps could that suggest for government agencies who might be responsible for information dissemination?
5921,U_5igBy5L3s.mp4,"I'm speaking on channel news Asia while I say this but um, I think people still have a high level of trust in all the traditional sources."
5922,U_5igBy5L3s.mp4,"So we asked participants to rate how much they trusted each source and radio newspapers TV all these had a rating of 3 out of 4, so it's very similar to the office show gathered as she wants a channel you want to compare this to online forums like Hardware zone or friends social media posts on the whole people rate this as much less trustworthy."
5923,U_5igBy5L3s.mp4,"So I think the Jaime just about finding is that people are saying that if the government makes an official statement, they're likely to trust it."
5924,U_5igBy5L3s.mp4,But that's it.
5925,U_5igBy5L3s.mp4,The nice thing about WhatsApp is that you get their messages across very quickly and you can forward them very easily.
5926,U_5igBy5L3s.mp4,So perhaps this is a good way to counter the the onslaught of fake news that is going around.
5927,U_5igBy5L3s.mp4,Yeah.
5928,U_5igBy5L3s.mp4,"Well speaking of that your report also said that it's not too clear why the use of a WhatsApp channel was linked with reduced and Ian symptoms, but can we have a sense of what some of these potential contributing factors are?"
5929,U_5igBy5L3s.mp4,Yeah.
5930,U_5igBy5L3s.mp4,"Oh, yeah, we were very pleased to discover that, you know using an official WhatsApp Channel could buffer a person from depression and anxiety after you factor how much time the president spends getting covid-19 updates."
5931,U_5igBy5L3s.mp4,Maybe this has to do with the info Dynamic again because we're so much poor information out there getting timely and reliable updates through WhatsApp.
5932,U_5igBy5L3s.mp4,"Maybe that could make a lot of difference Professor Liu people like Glenda and myself, we can't not know, you know what's going on with covid-19."
5933,U_5igBy5L3s.mp4,"We need those updates because we're in the news, but how can individuals perhaps balance, you know news consumption better during the pandemic."
5934,U_5igBy5L3s.mp4,"Yes, that's a very tricky one to balance for individuals."
5935,U_5igBy5L3s.mp4,I think the take-home message of our research is that you need to look for reliable sources and you probably should spend less than two hours a day getting update the lessons your job.
5936,U_5igBy5L3s.mp4,"Of course, that's the norm of how much people spend in terms of authorities as well."
5937,U_5igBy5L3s.mp4,I think Singapore has done a great job overall exploring different technological platforms to communicate risk to the public.
5938,U_5igBy5L3s.mp4,But one thing we need to keep in mind as a society is to keep on the Looking for those who are vulnerable.
5939,U_5igBy5L3s.mp4,So for groups that may not have access to high quality covid-19 information may be because of language barriers or technological access.
5940,U_5igBy5L3s.mp4,"So for these groups of people, we need to plug the gaps because our research is showing that this could make a difference for mental health during this pain hammock."
5941,U_5igBy5L3s.mp4,"Well, thank you so much for speaking to us and helping us understand."
5942,U_5igBy5L3s.mp4,There's a study we've been speaking to Gene you from the Yale and US College
5943,Q7gYIQQQuTo.mp4,You have patients that have respiratory symptoms and you have patients have a little bit of GI symptoms.
5944,Q7gYIQQQuTo.mp4,"Then you have patients that come in that have the respiratory symptoms a sore throat the cough the shortness of breath and the some of those symptoms can become quite severe but they come here and it might start.Office something very benign what they consider a benign, but they quickly decline in their health."
5945,Q7gYIQQQuTo.mp4,So they might come in from the emergency room.
5946,Q7gYIQQQuTo.mp4,They might be admitted to our one of our medical surgical areas.
5947,Q7gYIQQQuTo.mp4,They get sicker and sicker most of the time the patients need to have a breathing tube.
5948,Q7gYIQQQuTo.mp4,We called intubation.
5949,Q7gYIQQQuTo.mp4,They may be on that machine for weeks or a month you and I might breathe 24 or 25 percent oxygen.
5950,Q7gYIQQQuTo.mp4,Normally these patients are requiring.
5951,Q7gYIQQQuTo.mp4,And a hundred percent oxygen just to get them by because they are so sick and we want them to rest.
5952,Q7gYIQQQuTo.mp4,We put have to put them in high amounts of medications to paralyze them and sedate them just to keep their body from trying to fight the ventilator the data has been showing anywhere between 70 and 80 percent of the patients that end up intubated or breathing tube in their lungs.
5953,Q7gYIQQQuTo.mp4,Do not survive in order to potentially save patients.
5954,Q7gYIQQQuTo.mp4,We do something called proning or we call it.
5955,Q7gYIQQQuTo.mp4,Tummy time your lungs expand better when you're on your belly.
5956,Q7gYIQQQuTo.mp4,Most of us are not belly sleepers.
5957,Q7gYIQQQuTo.mp4,But in order for that patient to get as much oxygen Exchange in their lungs as possible.
5958,Q7gYIQQQuTo.mp4,We put them on their on their belly called proning.
5959,Q7gYIQQQuTo.mp4,"So we've grown our patients for anywhere from 16 to 18 hours at one time flip them over on their back and if they don't do well with their oxygen levels not very good, then we'll flip them back over in there on their tummy."
5960,Q7gYIQQQuTo.mp4,I think the longest that we've had somebody on their belly was about almost 44 hours because we just they were just too sick to even move on their back covid-19.
5961,Q7gYIQQQuTo.mp4,It causes severe respiratory failure in a very isolated group of patients.
5962,Q7gYIQQQuTo.mp4,These patients would inevitably pass away if we didn't have the ability to offer them some other form to oxygenate their blood and remove CO2.
5963,Q7gYIQQQuTo.mp4,That's why they end up on ECMO because ECMO is an artificial lung it allows the patient's lungs.
5964,Q7gYIQQQuTo.mp4,To rest they are no longer required to do the work that they normally do which would be to oxygenate and ventilate or remove CO2.
5965,Q7gYIQQQuTo.mp4,I think the toughest covid patient who we've placed on ECMO.
5966,Q7gYIQQQuTo.mp4,"Thus far has been a young patient there were many many days where we thought he was going to pass away and I remember saying at home, he doesn't make it."
5967,Q7gYIQQQuTo.mp4,I don't know if I can keep going with this job because it's so heartbreaking.
5968,Q7gYIQQQuTo.mp4,He pulled through he went home after 46 days on ECMO and it was It's really really amazing to see.
5969,Q7gYIQQQuTo.mp4,It's been extremely hard professionally personally emotionally were used to being able to help people and when you are not able to do what we went to school with what we went to what we've been trained for.
5970,Q7gYIQQQuTo.mp4,It's heartbreaking you are with patients who are at the brink of death and you are physically demanded of beyond what we've ever been trained to do in the past.
5971,Q7gYIQQQuTo.mp4,I'm inspired by the team that does this.
5972,5LR1liT22uo.mp4,"One of the most affected counties El Paso Texas is now under a two-week shut down because of the virus the County judge ordered all services deemed non-essential to close effective midnight yesterday, but the Texas Attorney General is now pushing back on that."
5973,5LR1liT22uo.mp4,I'm joined Now by El Paso Mayor de Margo with more on this mayor.
5974,5LR1liT22uo.mp4,Good morning.
5975,5LR1liT22uo.mp4,Thanks for being here happy to be here You released a statement saying the judge did not consult you on this shutdown and that he's refusing to return your calls.
5976,5LR1liT22uo.mp4,The Attorney General also says the judges action is violation of the governor's executive order and that he's exploring all legal actions.
5977,5LR1liT22uo.mp4,Do you expect this order to stand?
5978,5LR1liT22uo.mp4,"No, we do not and it's unfortunately to the County Judge didn't talk with me or have his legal department talk with our City's legal department."
5979,5LR1liT22uo.mp4,I mean that's what we've done for every order we've implemented since March when both of us have been pretty much in lockstep completely with all of our emergency directives.
5980,5LR1liT22uo.mp4,So we also know what the state of Texas will allow and not allow two of us have been on phone calls with the governor and I'm just disappointed that that there was no conversation with me before it won't it won't withstand.
5981,5LR1liT22uo.mp4,It will not stand up and and I mean people are hurting on both sides of this I've said from day one.
5982,5LR1liT22uo.mp4,"It's an unequal Balancing Act between our health our physical health our financial health and in our emotional health now, I feel like we're on a tight wire we have we're still having the problems with the with the Ed we think the spread is as a result of family shopping from our demographics it to go to the store as a family event the restaurants with we shut down I shut down restaurants at nine o'clock two weeks ago."
5983,5LR1liT22uo.mp4,We haven't you haven't yet seen what the impact will be.
5984,5LR1liT22uo.mp4,We talked to the governor about enforcement.
5985,5LR1liT22uo.mp4,We had a lot of bars that converted to restaurants and we've asked the Texas Alcoholic Beverage Control Board to come in and they sit the governor sent.
5986,5LR1liT22uo.mp4,20 inspectors in on Monday of this week to to enforce but on the other hand in addition to I honor our health care workers and all that.
5987,5LR1liT22uo.mp4,They're going through eye toward our alternate Care Facility yesterday seeing the tents pressurized tent set up outside the hospital's know what's going on.
5988,5LR1liT22uo.mp4,I know where we are.
5989,5LR1liT22uo.mp4,"I know what our numbers are, but at the same time we also have 32,000 El Paso ends out of work."
5990,5LR1liT22uo.mp4,And people are trying to put food on their table and pay for their own health care and needs and that's just this unequal Balancing Act Highwire whatever analogy want to use and that's the dilemma and the state will not allow us to shut down.
5991,5LR1liT22uo.mp4,The other cities that have tried that were rebuffed and told it was void.
5992,5LR1liT22uo.mp4,And that's why I didn't understand why the the County Judge unilaterally did this without conversation with me and we're looking at some video of some of Tents set up outside some of your hospitals you and you and I spoke just the other day and you were describing for us how they are setting up these outdoor tends to try to accommodate the influx of patients.
5993,5LR1liT22uo.mp4,Give us a sense of what's Happening inside those hospitals.
5994,5LR1liT22uo.mp4,"Well, they're overwhelmed right now."
5995,5LR1liT22uo.mp4,I did notice this morning's numbers that we had a reduction and I see use but we're basically at capacity and that's why the Texas Department of Emergency Management under the governor's orders sent out these tents.
5996,5LR1liT22uo.mp4,He sent trucks Mobile trucks.
5997,5LR1liT22uo.mp4,We set up an alternate care site or overflow of Kovac patients fact is the same organization that was in New York for three months and then they were in the Rio Grande Valley and as I Talk to them yesterday one of the things and there's our Hazard my staff talk to the Rio Grande Valley Mayors and what they went through.
5998,5LR1liT22uo.mp4,They determine when they were doing their real drill down that the majority of their spread of covid was from family gatherings in in homes.
5999,5LR1liT22uo.mp4,So it really wasn't out there in the public economy so to speak and that's what we've got to do.
6000,5LR1liT22uo.mp4,We've got to control we're a multi-generational households here.
6001,5LR1liT22uo.mp4,"We're our culture is to do things as groups and families their big families, you know, six seven eight children and and it's just it's just who we are as a nature and we've got to control that in the only way we're going to control it is just need to do what every epidemiologist says throughout the world and we're face coverings maintained a distance in the hygiene."
6002,5LR1liT22uo.mp4,"And so mayor, how do you control for that?"
6003,5LR1liT22uo.mp4,"You know, if you don't think the shutdown will stand and you don't think majority of the spread is happening in the public sphere."
6004,5LR1liT22uo.mp4,How do you get people to abide by more safety precautions within their own circles and within their own homes?
6005,5LR1liT22uo.mp4,We've been preaching that from day one.
6006,5LR1liT22uo.mp4,We'll continue to do that.
6007,5LR1liT22uo.mp4,We're trying to do the education as well.
6008,5LR1liT22uo.mp4,And we're trying to stop large Gatherings of any size at family homes.
6009,5LR1liT22uo.mp4,"And so if you don't need to be out at home and don't have large Gatherings, it's a matter of personal behavior and to a great extent."
6010,5LR1liT22uo.mp4,You can't legislate that it requires people to do.
6011,5LR1liT22uo.mp4,What's right and to understand the implications of not And that's what we're trying to get across.
6012,5LR1liT22uo.mp4,I all wishing you and the people there in El Paso the best right now mayor D Margo.
6013,5LR1liT22uo.mp4,We appreciate your time.
6014,5LR1liT22uo.mp4,Thank you.

6020,kO9W9DtMFik.mp4,"So proper someone who prepares for disasters emergencies and pretty much, you know pandemics like this."
6021,kO9W9DtMFik.mp4,We see bad outcomes in the future and react to it by preparing for that.
6022,kO9W9DtMFik.mp4,Whatever it might be.
6023,kO9W9DtMFik.mp4,These are the things that we line ourselves up for so that we don't get caught with our pants down.
6024,kO9W9DtMFik.mp4,"It's like getting car insurance, you know, you're going to get into an accident at some point in time."
6025,kO9W9DtMFik.mp4,"So, what do you do?car insurance And the new building structure, for example, my parents live in a dirty two-story building."
6026,kO9W9DtMFik.mp4,"I think there's something like 200 units in it, right?"
6027,kO9W9DtMFik.mp4,So with the building that big and that many units you're running into many transients plus you're running into people who are visiting them.
6028,kO9W9DtMFik.mp4,That's too much of an exposure when you get home.
6029,kO9W9DtMFik.mp4,You gotta wash your hands a dozen times.
6030,kO9W9DtMFik.mp4,"You got to disinfect the doorknobs and make sure you know that you didn't in fact it so that there's there's too many variables with buildings that big it's why not Red's left the city and went to PA if you live in a home here in the best case scenario because it's your home, you know who is coming in and out, you know that once you wipe down the surface as you fine, so I mean listen for a two-week lockdown the Necessities are our food and water."
6031,kO9W9DtMFik.mp4,"I mean, you know and your own personal medical supplies, that's all you're going to need and you should only buy Foods you're going to eat when it just because Sam's on sale doesn't mean you should buy that crap in my pantry."
6032,kO9W9DtMFik.mp4,I have a lot of canned goods.
6033,kO9W9DtMFik.mp4,"I have Chef Boyardee which I grew up on Zoom reason why I still eating tuna fish corned beef hash can beans tomato sauce to make, you know, like pasta and red sauce stuff Dry Cereal and meats that are in the freezer, but I vacuum sealed the meats."
6034,kO9W9DtMFik.mp4,So they last longer you get probably almost a Out of a lot of it if you vacuum seal it if you have kids make sure you have an abundant amount of snacks so they can eat three times a day.
6035,kO9W9DtMFik.mp4,So when you calculate how much food you should have you should calculate three meals a day for 15 days and then you take and me personally you take one meal out.
6036,kO9W9DtMFik.mp4,So now you're eat you extended your 15 days to something.
6037,kO9W9DtMFik.mp4,Like I don't know what 22 days or something like that.
6038,kO9W9DtMFik.mp4,"So you should rational if your food, but you shouldn't rationale for war rationing off water."
6039,kO9W9DtMFik.mp4,It's bad because you can put yourself in a dehydrated State.
6040,kO9W9DtMFik.mp4,"Everybody should have two gallons of water per person per day because one of those gowns are going to be used to keeping yourself clean the other gallons for you to drink if you have pets and you have to prepare for a lockdown, for example my dog."
6041,kO9W9DtMFik.mp4,"I'm buying bags of food each week to 50 pounds of bag, but he should be good a month of back."
6042,kO9W9DtMFik.mp4,So I'm going to buy him two more bags and hopefully this thing passes and three.
6043,kO9W9DtMFik.mp4,"If not, he's going to be eaten."
6044,kO9W9DtMFik.mp4,"With food and not humans, but like you know how stuff we have stored away."
6045,kO9W9DtMFik.mp4,"There's no such thing as going overboard with stocking your pantry, right so you can I don't know you can go bananas all you want but it also helps because if you want to, you know, give a neighbor food or something like that."
6046,kO9W9DtMFik.mp4,You can't the anxiety of getting sick anxiety of staying in the apartment.
6047,kO9W9DtMFik.mp4,Hartman for days on end.
6048,kO9W9DtMFik.mp4,You could break that monotony with you know entertainment.
6049,kO9W9DtMFik.mp4,"This is not 1918, right?"
6050,kO9W9DtMFik.mp4,This is 20/20.
6051,kO9W9DtMFik.mp4,So we have technology to keep us busy.
6052,kO9W9DtMFik.mp4,We have Netflix in the rest of those who keep us busy.
6053,kO9W9DtMFik.mp4,"If the power goes out that's a different ball game altogether, but that I would I would venture to say by a couple board games, you know, just in case you get tired of TV and then talking if you have someone to talk to if you live alone, I don't know draw a face on a wall talk to that but you know if you live alone."
6054,kO9W9DtMFik.mp4,You're gonna have to do a lot of texting and phone calls.
6055,kO9W9DtMFik.mp4,"If not, then talk to whoever you're in the hospital that helps do some workouts push-ups and squats."
6056,kO9W9DtMFik.mp4,If you have a pull-up bar do that jump rope.
6057,kO9W9DtMFik.mp4,If you have one you have a yoga mat do some yoga.
6058,kO9W9DtMFik.mp4,"I don't do that crap, but I hear works as far as my home gym goes I don't have one."
6059,kO9W9DtMFik.mp4,What I do have is I collect programs online to do home workouts.
6060,kO9W9DtMFik.mp4,She could use a water jokes because they're a pounds right so beautiful.
6061,kO9W9DtMFik.mp4,"You put them on a rope on a stick curl that you know, there's different little crude things you can do."
6062,kO9W9DtMFik.mp4,A lockdown is important in this situation because of how fast the virus spreads.
6063,kO9W9DtMFik.mp4,"But if you go against the quarantine rules or the lockdown rules, you're helping the virus spread, right?"
6064,kO9W9DtMFik.mp4,So you're taking a person who's sick introducing the someone healthy and getting them sick for what if your own personal gains or whatever.
6065,kO9W9DtMFik.mp4,It is.
6066,kO9W9DtMFik.mp4,History has taught us that quarantine works.
6067,dXL3lJU9mZU.mp4,You may have heard that contact tracing is one way to help stop the spread of covid-19.
6068,dXL3lJU9mZU.mp4,But what is contact tracing contact tracing is finding people who may be infectious or contagious with covid-19 and may not know it and telling them to stay home and away from others.
6069,dXL3lJU9mZU.mp4,So they don't infect anyone else.
6070,dXL3lJU9mZU.mp4,After someone has been exposed to covid-19.
6071,dXL3lJU9mZU.mp4,"They can start spreading it to other people anywhere from 2 to 14 days later during this time people may not feel sick, but they could still pass covid-19 onto others."
6072,dXL3lJU9mZU.mp4,This is how more and more people get infected contact tracing is one way to stop this cycle.
6073,dXL3lJU9mZU.mp4,This is how it works.
6074,dXL3lJU9mZU.mp4,The Minnesota Department of Health is notified of every person who test positive for covid-19.
6075,dXL3lJU9mZU.mp4,Just like with the measles.
6076,dXL3lJU9mZU.mp4,"If you test positive for covid-19, you can expect a call from a covid-19 case interviewer."
6077,dXL3lJU9mZU.mp4,Sometimes they're also called Contact tracers case interviewers work for State local or tribal Health Department's case interviewers call to give you information about covid-19 ask you about your health and answer your questions.
6078,dXL3lJU9mZU.mp4,They will first read you something called a Tennyson warning.
6079,dXL3lJU9mZU.mp4,"This is information about privacy and asks, if you're okay with sharing your health information your information cannot be shared with anyone without your permission."
6080,dXL3lJU9mZU.mp4,They also asked about who you had close contact with starting a few days before you tested positive in general anyone who has spent more than 15 minutes within a close distance with someone who has covid-19 is called a contact the Interviewer will help you figure out who is considered a contact case interviewers can then call your contacts and talk with them about getting tested.
6081,dXL3lJU9mZU.mp4,They will not share your name or any other personal information with your contacts without your permission.
6082,dXL3lJU9mZU.mp4,"They will tell them to stay home for 14 days counting from their last close contact with you if they stay home their germs stay home, too."
6083,dXL3lJU9mZU.mp4,Contact tracing only works with your help.
6084,dXL3lJU9mZU.mp4,If a case interviewer calls you be sure to answer your phone.
6085,dXL3lJU9mZU.mp4,"If you miss their call, they will leave a message."
6086,dXL3lJU9mZU.mp4,Be sure to call them back case interviewers always tell you who they are who they work for and that they're calling about covid-19.
6087,dXL3lJU9mZU.mp4,They will never ask about your immigration status for money or for your bank credit card or social security numbers.
6088,dXL3lJU9mZU.mp4,"If you prefer not to speak English, let the case interviewer know they will get a different interviewer who speaks your language or use a phone interpreter interviewers also share information with you things like how to protect the people you live with and how to get food medicine and other things you may need to stay safe at home together with the help of contact tracing and case interviewers."
6089,dXL3lJU9mZU.mp4,We can slow the spread of covid-19.
6090,dXL3lJU9mZU.mp4,Thank you for doing your part.
6091,-pCaZrEBMFc.mp4,I need has been great to great opportunity for me to be able to share thoughts ideas and collaborate with peers from different academic disciplines or fields and also with practitioners on how to better understand the current information environment the flows of misinformation and disinformation how to better prevent and respond to info Dynamics and to how to measure the the effects of exposure ofInformation on this information by individuals similarities and dissimilarities between the spreading of a disease and the spreading of information the most relevant one being that information travels much faster than a biological virus.
6092,-pCaZrEBMFc.mp4,One of the most interesting things I heard about was the use of personas in the development of targeted communication materials.
6093,-pCaZrEBMFc.mp4,This really gets to the critical role of identity in this issue.
6094,-pCaZrEBMFc.mp4,I enjoy participating in the Sprints and learning about how others from so many different fields have approached info demick problems.
6095,-pCaZrEBMFc.mp4,"We've been working on NLP and machine learning for understanding social issues, but being able to learn about the need and social value of this for misinformation in the area of Health has been eye-opening for me about not only what information is communicated to different audiences, but how it is translated and then received and the rule importance of understanding different communities perceptions of what valuable thing I valued most about the conference was the ability to cross the Divide from research to practice to learn from experiences that people have had promoting evidence and debunking misinformation in the real world and in very different online and offline environment and was in topic to when I miss Iceland and masato kashimoto provided their lessons on information environments, we have used this interactive online mind mapping tool to together create a visual graphic of how misinformation can be addressed where misinformation originates."
6096,-pCaZrEBMFc.mp4,How can we deal with it?
6097,-pCaZrEBMFc.mp4,How can we police and how it can be corrected?
6098,-pCaZrEBMFc.mp4,And also what role social media place is clear that some practices and methodologies are transferable.
6099,-pCaZrEBMFc.mp4,"It's clear that we can share these methodologies, but it's also clear that we are moving towards looking at ways that we can intervene to protect global."
6100,-pCaZrEBMFc.mp4,So I'm happy to make connections with people from many disciplines and I think solving a complex problem like misinformation would require a global effort a coordinated effort.
6101,-pCaZrEBMFc.mp4,And I think this first World Health Organization was a very good step towards this goal.
6102,-pCaZrEBMFc.mp4,I think that it's extremely important especially for these new challenging Visions to have a test like this because what happens today is that the spite of all the resources that we Have there is not enough diversity in our discussions that that was absolutely crucial step forward.
6103,-pCaZrEBMFc.mp4,I'm not just meeting with people who are smart and intelligent.
6104,-pCaZrEBMFc.mp4,They are also have big hearts and I think that is the most important thing when we discuss each other complement each other embracing each other.
6105,-pCaZrEBMFc.mp4,I became realized that working in this field.
6106,-pCaZrEBMFc.mp4,We need diverse perspective.
6107,-pCaZrEBMFc.mp4,And also we need collaboration more and more us.
6108,-pCaZrEBMFc.mp4,We need a coordinated response to fight misinformation.
6109,-pCaZrEBMFc.mp4,Ian and established a community of practice which facilitates sharing of best practices and also coordinate our response.

6118,aiEHFqJTjXs.mp4,"Yeah, good morning Carl."
6119,aiEHFqJTjXs.mp4,Anneli that that of course is the million dollar question at the moment really.
6120,aiEHFqJTjXs.mp4,It's a big task to in fact actually manufacture vaccines to the doses for the whole population.
6121,aiEHFqJTjXs.mp4,And the best way to in fact actually start.
6122,aiEHFqJTjXs.mp4,"This is a staged introduction and those people most in need of having the vaccine, of course our health workers as we know the majority of cases in Australia have occurred in health workers and for us to keep our Health Care system going we need them to be in Tip-Top shape for them today."
6123,aiEHFqJTjXs.mp4,Talking about March it does suggest that the manufacturers are pretty confident.
6124,aiEHFqJTjXs.mp4,"Yeah, look at that."
6125,aiEHFqJTjXs.mp4,"It does sound like a lot of confidence as the phase 3 trials continue on and without any other Holtz, although again."
6126,aiEHFqJTjXs.mp4,"I remind everybody that phase 3 is where we actually look to see how safe the vaccine is and any of these trials that are going on at the moment could halt at any moment now but being optimistic because time is running on and some of these trials will be reaching the end of their of their Time by the end of the round about late November is some of them and in fact most of them by end of December, which means we are going to start to see the results of those studies."
6127,aiEHFqJTjXs.mp4,I think it's complex.
6128,aiEHFqJTjXs.mp4,I just need to point out that a lot of these studies are what we call blind at studies.
6129,aiEHFqJTjXs.mp4,So we don't know who's had the vaccine and who hasn't had the vaccine and norda anyone who's doing the studies and they don't crack those codes until the end of the actual study so we don't find out the results until then so best-case scenario.
6130,aiEHFqJTjXs.mp4,What's the time?
6131,aiEHFqJTjXs.mp4,That we're looking at do you think the best case scenario if one of SE?
6132,aiEHFqJTjXs.mp4,The the life stage contenders actually get through this race at the moment is that we may have an announcement at the end of the year that their success they still have to go through the idea of actually manufacturing to scale.
6133,aiEHFqJTjXs.mp4,So this is what the announcement yesterday was about that CSL in Australia certainly now starting to look at the idea of commissioning the factory that will be making one of the successful potentially successful vaccine.
6134,aiEHFqJTjXs.mp4,"He's in the Oxford AstraZeneca one under license and they will then obviously the first doses of those will probably start coming off the line in the early parts of the year, which is really what the minister was talking about yesterday those early early samples of the vaccine coming off if it's successful would be directed towards health workers."
6135,aiEHFqJTjXs.mp4,"It was really interesting listening to the minister yesterday because he was talking about obviously the Oxford University and the University of Queensland vaccines, but also to others so we could potentially when they are rolled out there could be four different types."
6136,aiEHFqJTjXs.mp4,Vaccines that we're taking sort of depending on I guess what age we are what bracket we fall into?
6137,aiEHFqJTjXs.mp4,"Yeah, look that's right."
6138,aiEHFqJTjXs.mp4,So we do have Johnson & Johnson fires a AstraZeneca have certainly some of the most developed candidates the other two can't be made in Australia because the vaccine is not made in just a vaccine Factory.
6139,aiEHFqJTjXs.mp4,It has to have a specified Factory for each vaccine and they have to have regulation and compliance to a whole range of stringent.
6140,aiEHFqJTjXs.mp4,And so it's not something you can just do and the big bold push here has been to actually make factories for vaccines that haven't yet been proven so they may actually not be made.
6141,aiEHFqJTjXs.mp4,"So we're looking at vast sums of money going into making factories that may not be used in that sort of setting but hey, the stakes are pretty high we're looking at what's happening in Europe at the moment sure are the federal government wants free movement around the country by Christmas."
6142,aiEHFqJTjXs.mp4,Is there any medical reason why that shouldn't happen.
6143,aiEHFqJTjXs.mp4,It's extremely exciting how the virus is actually been.
6144,aiEHFqJTjXs.mp4,Washed literally in Victoria.
6145,aiEHFqJTjXs.mp4,One of the things we need to understand is it's still circulating in the community.
6146,aiEHFqJTjXs.mp4,So we still need to maintain our social distancing and also anybody with symptoms needs to get tested.
6147,aiEHFqJTjXs.mp4,That's what you need to do in that place as that moves on I think the confidence of opening up a stray Leah for Australia's to have free passage is an exciting prospect and we're seeing that already with Western Australia talking about releasing it for some other countries and sorry other states and hopefully for Us victorians we can start to move out of Victoria's.
6148,aiEHFqJTjXs.mp4,"Well, that'll be really exciting will be good Christmas present."
6149,aiEHFqJTjXs.mp4,Wouldn't it?
6150,aiEHFqJTjXs.mp4,"Thank you, Doctor."
6151,aiEHFqJTjXs.mp4,"We appreciate your time with him, Mass Exodus."
6152,cxx32N3MGoo.mp4,"Sure, if we go back to the bottom left, that's our normal tongue feature."
6153,cxx32N3MGoo.mp4,This is not all of the 30 but these are the tongues of those initial 30 and we see two main features most of them have what we would term is a thick white tongue coat.
6154,cxx32N3MGoo.mp4,That's what we term is greasy.
6155,cxx32N3MGoo.mp4,It's kind of moist on the second row and the far Left and the far right those are good examples of that where the tongue coat itself is more thicker than we want to see it and it's white and nature.
6156,cxx32N3MGoo.mp4,The tongue body itself is almost swollen.
6157,cxx32N3MGoo.mp4,We see this kind of center crack down the middle of most of these tongues.
6158,cxx32N3MGoo.mp4,These patients are retaining water.
6159,cxx32N3MGoo.mp4,They're having issues with water.
6160,cxx32N3MGoo.mp4,They're having issues with normal secretions.
6161,cxx32N3MGoo.mp4,We know with most of the patients.
6162,cxx32N3MGoo.mp4,They have dry unproductive coughs dry throats.
6163,cxx32N3MGoo.mp4,"However, what we see is the action of this pathogen is that it's not allowing the body to make normal normal fluid secretions of the nasal passages and the respiratory system."
6164,cxx32N3MGoo.mp4,And throat and the mouth it's stagnating it.
6165,cxx32N3MGoo.mp4,It's it's stopping it to such an extent that the fluids are thickening and they're not circulating normatively in the body.
6166,cxx32N3MGoo.mp4,"So there is phlegm there is sputum for these patients, but it's just clogging up the bronchioles."
6167,cxx32N3MGoo.mp4,It's not thin and easily expectorated.
6168,cxx32N3MGoo.mp4,And so we Define this pattern as cold and damp
6169,y39Y6ANewME.mp4,It's a massive massive trend for for a every health system because we see everyday 50 to 60 patients who come to us.
6170,y39Y6ANewME.mp4,Our emergency department pneumonia and most of them are so severe they need very high fio2 or oxygen and so it's we have to reorganize our emergency room and our Hospital in three levels of intensity as you do so.
6171,y39Y6ANewME.mp4,I never filled so stress in my life.
6172,y39Y6ANewME.mp4,I'm an intensivist.
6173,y39Y6ANewME.mp4,Mmm.

6178,GwFmk6PgmqI.mp4,"Yeah, that's the cough after I threw up I could breathe."
6179,GwFmk6PgmqI.mp4,Once you get to the other side of it.
6180,GwFmk6PgmqI.mp4,You can breathe a little bit better.
6181,GwFmk6PgmqI.mp4,"I mean, it's the weirdest thing."
6182,GwFmk6PgmqI.mp4,My muscles ached and my joints ache really bad.
6183,GwFmk6PgmqI.mp4,It felt like somebody was like stabbing me with an ice pick a cold and a flu can sometimes cause a really runny nose and sort of a more sort of mucus feeling inside in your coffin.
6184,GwFmk6PgmqI.mp4,"And in your nose, whereas this virus seems to be much more of a dry cough as the infection can progress the symptoms will change from just a dry cough to actually difficulty breathing."
6185,GwFmk6PgmqI.mp4,May I come in the room?
6186,GwFmk6PgmqI.mp4,"They had to wear these Ebola suits and man so, you know, I really can't see them and you know, they had loved up and down to up so they come in here and do what they have to do and then they leave so it's a terrible feeling."
6187,GwFmk6PgmqI.mp4,"I mean you feel like you just cut off from the whole world oxygen levels are starting to rise and I'm starting to feel air in my lungs again, and I'm able to breathe freely now."
6188,GwFmk6PgmqI.mp4,People who are sick should stay home.
6189,GwFmk6PgmqI.mp4,You don't go to an emergency room.
6190,GwFmk6PgmqI.mp4,"You don't go to a clinic you get on the phone and you ask for advice and instructions from your physician, then you use those instructions to determine what you're going to do, but the first reflex should not be I feel sick."
6191,GwFmk6PgmqI.mp4,I'm going to go to an emergency room.
6192,GwFmk6PgmqI.mp4,I feel sick.
6193,GwFmk6PgmqI.mp4,I'm going to just go to a doctor's office.
6194,GwFmk6PgmqI.mp4,We need to physically separate ultimately.
6195,GwFmk6PgmqI.mp4,You may need obviously to see a physician.
6196,GwFmk6PgmqI.mp4,You go to a hospital.
6197,GwFmk6PgmqI.mp4,The first reflex should be to make a call to your physician.

6300,wgKuhGi1eJY.mp4,Right.
6301,wgKuhGi1eJY.mp4,Now we don't have any Community spread.
6302,wgKuhGi1eJY.mp4,I wouldn't be surprised if we have some Community spread within the next two to three weeks.
6303,wgKuhGi1eJY.mp4,"You know, our Healthcare institutions have been preparing for this for well over a month now Protocols are in place for how to care for folks that have coronavirus."
6304,wgKuhGi1eJY.mp4,Most people that get coronavirus don't actually get that sick.
6305,wgKuhGi1eJY.mp4,But we're needing to do is be thoughtful about who might get more sick and how do we be how We take extra caution for those people.
6306,wgKuhGi1eJY.mp4,And so I think that's where the guidance from the CDC and public health has come out about particularly elderly.
6307,wgKuhGi1eJY.mp4,People are at higher risk of this virus making them very sick.
6308,wgKuhGi1eJY.mp4,And so that is why people will be hearing about different changes in policies and nursing facilities or even the hospital about visitors and coming and going the whole idea is to try and decrease the exposure to at-risk populations.
6309,wgKuhGi1eJY.mp4,Other at-risk populations are people that have chronic diseases like diabetes or heart disease or kidney disease with any infection people that are immunocompromised are at risk for that infection.
6310,wgKuhGi1eJY.mp4,And and that makes sense.
6311,wgKuhGi1eJY.mp4,If somebody's immune system does not work fully then if they get a new infection that infection generally has more time to cause problems in their body before their immune system reacts So I think that would include people that are getting chemotherapy people that are on chronic steroids or people that have a known immunodeficiency.
6312,wgKuhGi1eJY.mp4,You hear it said somebody has a very strong immune system and never get sick or they have a weak immune system and they always get sick and for people that don't have specific reasons to have an immunocompromised status.
6313,wgKuhGi1eJY.mp4,"I would feel that this virus probably isn't any different than any other virus, but it would be a high Risk for people that have a known immunocompromise in condition such as certain medications or certain diseases that would put them at higher risk."
6314,wgKuhGi1eJY.mp4,I would say that they should probably follow similar recommendations as the CDC has put out for elderly people or people with other chronic conditions as well.
6315,EGVPSdp4iLs.mp4,there are many tests available for viruses such as covid-19 these tests fall into two main groups those that detect whether you currently have the virus and those that detect antibodies to that virus both are important for understanding who is infected and might transmit the virus to others who has had the virus and might be immune and even who might potentially help others with treatment coronavirus is in genetic material in the form of a short single strand of RNA that is unique to that virus new ways of detecting these small sequences are being developed.
6316,EGVPSdp4iLs.mp4,"But the most common method uses a process called reverse transcriptase polymerase Chain Reaction or rt-pcr first, the RNA is converted to DNA and then replicated until the sample is large enough for genetic analysis."
6317,EGVPSdp4iLs.mp4,"If the DNA profile matches the profile of the virus, the test will be positive confirming an infection."
6318,EGVPSdp4iLs.mp4,The other type of testing identifies whether antibodies to the virus are present in your blood antibodies are specialized proteins that are produced by your immune system during a viral attack.
6319,EGVPSdp4iLs.mp4,"They bond to foreign substances like viruses and bacteria neutralizing them antibody testing looks for IGM antibodies, which appear within days of an infection and IGG antibodies that remain in the blood and provide long-term protection if enough antibodies are present in your body."
6320,EGVPSdp4iLs.mp4,It may even be possible for doctors to use your blood plasma to treat others.
6321,EGVPSdp4iLs.mp4,"However, there is still much to learn about how strongly antibodies respond to new viruses like covid-19 and how long any immune protection will persist many new tests are being developed and policymakers are working to ensure their safety accuracy and accessibility."
6322,VIZouD5qaLM.mp4,The aim of test track and Trace is to hunt down and isolate the virus.
6323,VIZouD5qaLM.mp4,So it's unable to reproduce we're building an army of human contact tracers.
6324,VIZouD5qaLM.mp4,"And of course, we're developing the contact tracing app, which can help us deliver test track and trace on the mass scale that we need across the country."
6325,VIZouD5qaLM.mp4,Contact tracing is one of the main pillars the government strategy to ease our Nationwide lockdown but how do we make sure it's effective.
6326,VIZouD5qaLM.mp4,We need to solve the problem of how to get out of lockdown and how to resume aspects of our normal life while at the same time making sure that people who are at risk of transmitting the virus still continue to self isolation and quarantine.
6327,VIZouD5qaLM.mp4,So contact racing is one of the key Those this is Krista Fraser.
6328,VIZouD5qaLM.mp4,He's the senior group leader in pathogen Dynamics at Oxford University's Big Data Institute.
6329,VIZouD5qaLM.mp4,He explained to me how contact tracing supposed to work.
6330,VIZouD5qaLM.mp4,You don't need to block all of the transmission to stop an epidemic all together.
6331,VIZouD5qaLM.mp4,You just need to be blocking enough transmission.
6332,VIZouD5qaLM.mp4,That each person is infecting less than one on average.
6333,VIZouD5qaLM.mp4,"So the question is, you know, how quick and how comprehensive this just contact tracing need to be to maintain epidemic control."
6334,VIZouD5qaLM.mp4,He's worth saying here the actual immunity only safely be obtained by vaccination.
6335,VIZouD5qaLM.mp4,What we're talking about rather is sustained epidemic suppression.
6336,VIZouD5qaLM.mp4,In other words keeping the number of infections very low.
6337,VIZouD5qaLM.mp4,So what we found is when we modeled conventional contact tracing even if we made very ambitious assumptions about how quickly that could be done and the virus would always sort of stay one step ahead.
6338,VIZouD5qaLM.mp4,"So the by the time you found people with a contact raising teams, They would be substantially through their periods of infectious."
6339,VIZouD5qaLM.mp4,"So we're digital contact tracing changes that was this idea that you could have an app short-circuit the process of contact tracing and that sort of that gain of maybe one two, or even three days compared to what can be done with manual contact tracing would be enough that if you get that information and you act on it that would be enough to reduce transmission."
6340,VIZouD5qaLM.mp4,So to make sure contact tracing is effective you need to be able to do it quickly and with a high proportion of the population.
6341,VIZouD5qaLM.mp4,Which is why digital contact tracing is already a reality in many countries around the world with admittedly varying degrees of success and soon we'll be using this in the UK as well.
6342,VIZouD5qaLM.mp4,So let's look at the technology.
6343,VIZouD5qaLM.mp4,How does the contact tracing at work?
6344,VIZouD5qaLM.mp4,You can set a phone to constantly be paying out a beacon going.
6345,VIZouD5qaLM.mp4,Hi.
6346,VIZouD5qaLM.mp4,I'm here.
6347,VIZouD5qaLM.mp4,"Hi, I'm here and to constantly be listening for similar beacons from other phones."
6348,VIZouD5qaLM.mp4,Then you end up with a loose network of people who you've been in close contact with what that means in theory isn't there any of those people learn later that they have had covid and that they've been infectious for say four days.
6349,VIZouD5qaLM.mp4,They can automatically worn every single person that they've come in contact with over the previous four days that they may have been exposed to covid-19.
6350,VIZouD5qaLM.mp4,The dream is that every single person they meet in the Infectious period gets a warning because they're their phones work and the system works correctly and their self isolates and doesn't spread it onto everyone else.
6351,VIZouD5qaLM.mp4,"Obviously, it won't Work perfectly and so the two big questions that we have going forward are firstly how well can this work and secondly, what are the costs and trade-offs to trying it this way."
6352,VIZouD5qaLM.mp4,These are massive questions.
6353,VIZouD5qaLM.mp4,"And in terms of trade offs, one of the biggest issues is where the privacy concerns about the apps data collection will prevent the necessary uptake we need from the population because if people aren't using the app, then we have a problem."
6354,VIZouD5qaLM.mp4,You have to download the app.
6355,VIZouD5qaLM.mp4,"If you don't download the app, you don't have to happen."
6356,VIZouD5qaLM.mp4,You're not contact tracing after that.
6357,VIZouD5qaLM.mp4,"We start falling into into the technical implementation things like whether or not the app stays running in the background whether or not the app gets shut down to preserve power or to restore memory whether or not the app automatically restarts if you restart your phone, or if you have to remember to turn it on whether or not your phone runs out of battery these things will slice off a large chunk."
6358,VIZouD5qaLM.mp4,No matter how well it's done.
6359,VIZouD5qaLM.mp4,So it's not perfect and even if it was not everybody has a smartphone and some people have very old smartphones.
6360,VIZouD5qaLM.mp4,Would be new enough to run an app like this.
6361,VIZouD5qaLM.mp4,"There is one other potential weak link for even the best design covid app, which is you need to know you have covid this app is useless without a thorough testing regime which we don't have fundamentally."
6362,VIZouD5qaLM.mp4,We don't yet have the scale of a testing infrastructure that will allow anyone to get a test if they think they have the symptoms but it is a problem that needs to be solved before this contact tracing infrastructure can really start bringing down.
6363,VIZouD5qaLM.mp4,The number of transmissions in the number of infections contact tracing cannot work in isolation.
6364,VIZouD5qaLM.mp4,"Yes, it's important but it's just one of the necessary measures we need to get right to the extent that is that will really work."
6365,VIZouD5qaLM.mp4,They were work when they're integrated into a public health response with manual contact tracing with the messaging around social distancing with national testing programs as a package of measures that have a very clear aim stopping infections is a very difficult task.
6366,VIZouD5qaLM.mp4,"It is a difficult infection to manage, but it's not an impossible one keeping."
6367,VIZouD5qaLM.mp4,The infection levels really low can be done.
6368,VIZouD5qaLM.mp4,We don't know whether the government strategy around contact tracing work a lot Still Remains to be seen there.
6369,VIZouD5qaLM.mp4,Is this big lingering issue privacy and the app we want to hear what your concerns are so leave them in the comments below and we'll do our best to answer them.
6370,syXd7kgLSN8.mp4,Covid-19 Diagnostics performing a nasopharyngeal oropharyngeal swab it is essential to follow proper infection control measures when samples are collected from patients with a suspected coronavirus infection among other things The Examiner should wear an n95 respirator mask gown protective goggles and gloves to save resources.
6371,syXd7kgLSN8.mp4,We will refrain from using each of these items in this video.
6372,syXd7kgLSN8.mp4,"Leo and instead only show the technical details of sample collection, let's begin with a nasopharyngeal swab The patient should be alert and Cooperative allow them to first blow their nose."
6373,syXd7kgLSN8.mp4,The patient should sit in a relaxed and comfortable position during the sample collection process tilt the patient's head back slightly and support it with your non-dominant hand if necessary lean the patient's head against a wall to minimize jerky movements stand slightly offset from the patient to avoid the risk of contamination in case of a sudden cough or sneeze.
6374,syXd7kgLSN8.mp4,"He's be sure to advise the patient of potential discomfort during sample collection and let the patient know that they are welcome to close their eyes sample collection should only be completed using sterile swabs made from artificial cotton with flexible plastic shafts, calcium alginate swabs or swabs with wooden shafts must not be used."
6375,syXd7kgLSN8.mp4,These materials can inactivate viral particles or inhibit PCR tests.
6376,syXd7kgLSN8.mp4,Furthermore wooden shafts are likely to cause patient injury Hold the swab like a pen between the thumb index and middle fingers maintain a loose.
6377,syXd7kgLSN8.mp4,Grip that allows the swab to accommodate any resistance encountered during sample collection to reduce the risk of injury avoid using the following hand position during sample collection start by inserting the swab horizontally into the left or right nostril carefully Advanced the swab while maintaining a course that is close to both the septum and the floor of the nose.
6378,syXd7kgLSN8.mp4,LL to the palate do not Advance the swab upwards but instead straight back until resistance is felt as the swab reaches the posterior nasopharynx when collecting samples from an adult patient this corresponds to a travel distance of approximately five to six centimeters or two inches leave the swab at this depth for a few seconds while gently wiping the wall by twisting the swab shaft slowly and gently remove the swab.
6379,syXd7kgLSN8.mp4,"Immediately insert the swab into the sample collection tube, which may contain 2 to 3 milliliters of viral transport media."
6380,syXd7kgLSN8.mp4,If a nasopharyngeal swab cannot be collected for any reason an oropharyngeal sample can be also collected through the mouth again inform the patient at this smear will feel uncomfortable for a short time and may trigger a gag reflex.
6381,syXd7kgLSN8.mp4,"Ask the patient to open their mouths wide protrude their tongue forward and say ahh, depress the patient's tongue using a tongue depressor gently insert the swab into the oral cavity without touching the lips."
6382,syXd7kgLSN8.mp4,Tongue hard palate or soft palate.
6383,syXd7kgLSN8.mp4,These surfaces should be avoided as they are often colonised by a wide range of microbes.
6384,syXd7kgLSN8.mp4,"Collect the sample from the back wall of the throat twist the swab shaft gently, but thoroughly sampling the oral pharyngeal wall just as with the nasopharyngeal swab the oropharyngeal swab should now be placed into the sample collection tube and sent to the laboratory as quickly as possible."
6385,Z6joGL66cbQ.mp4,Hi everyone.
6386,Z6joGL66cbQ.mp4,"My name is Ila you might of heard that there's a virus going around her covid-19, but can make people feel sick last week."
6387,Z6joGL66cbQ.mp4,I was feeling a little sick.
6388,Z6joGL66cbQ.mp4,I had a favor.
6389,Z6joGL66cbQ.mp4,So sorry and a bit of a cough.
6390,Z6joGL66cbQ.mp4,So I went to the world hasn't hospital to have a special test done.
6391,Z6joGL66cbQ.mp4,I watched his a little while and then Chelsea - took me to another room.
6392,Z6joGL66cbQ.mp4,She was wearing some strange things could personal protective equipment or PPE for sure.
6393,Z6joGL66cbQ.mp4,She wore a gown to cover her clothes.
6394,Z6joGL66cbQ.mp4,I'm asked to cover her mouth and ours.
6395,Z6joGL66cbQ.mp4,I chilled her glasses.
6396,Z6joGL66cbQ.mp4,To cover our eyes and gloves to cover her hands to protect herself in case I had to covid-19 virus and help keep me safe from germs to underneath all the PPE is my friendliness Chelsea.
6397,Z6joGL66cbQ.mp4,First Chelsea check my temperature.
6398,Z6joGL66cbQ.mp4,little birdies I measured my heartbeat.
6399,Z6joGL66cbQ.mp4,And then we went to another room for the test.
6400,Z6joGL66cbQ.mp4,I sat on the green chair and Mom sat next to me.
6401,Z6joGL66cbQ.mp4,I hold my mom's hand kept my chin up.
6402,Z6joGL66cbQ.mp4,Stay very still took a big deep breath to help me feel calm and then Chelsea's the long fluffy stick to touch.
6403,Z6joGL66cbQ.mp4,My tonsils are back of my throat.
6404,Z6joGL66cbQ.mp4,It's got a little bit.
6405,Z6joGL66cbQ.mp4,Tingly.
6406,Z6joGL66cbQ.mp4,I sat on my mom's lap for the next part mom gave me a big hug die very soon.
6407,Z6joGL66cbQ.mp4,"I took a big deep breath to help me feel calm and then Chelsea, he's a long fluffy stick to take some snot out of one nostril now do the other side?"
6408,Z6joGL66cbQ.mp4,Okay.
6409,Z6joGL66cbQ.mp4,And then they have other this father bit.
6410,Z6joGL66cbQ.mp4,Tingly and made my eyes water a little.
6411,Z6joGL66cbQ.mp4,It goes to the lab now to go home stay inside until I get my test results.
6412,Z6joGL66cbQ.mp4,See ya.
6413,Y3zKRHzccMk.mp4,A backtrack from the CDC tonight over how covid-19 spreads official guidance posted Friday said Airborne transmission is the primary way.
6414,Y3zKRHzccMk.mp4,The virus is spread.
6415,Y3zKRHzccMk.mp4,The CDC says new changes to its covid guidance were posted in error guidance that represented a major change in how coronavirus is transmitted.
6416,Y3zKRHzccMk.mp4,This is not a failure of Public Health.
6417,Y3zKRHzccMk.mp4,It's a failure to support and be guided by public health.
6418,Y3zKRHzccMk.mp4,What was once a win for some health experts?
6419,Y3zKRHzccMk.mp4,"Quickly return to frustration for months many in the scientific Community had been advocating that aerosols spread covid-19, but the CDC maintains that the virus mainly spreads through large respiratory droplets encountered at close range."
6420,Y3zKRHzccMk.mp4,"We've been frustrated on the health agencies, and we've been frustrated that they've been so slow we had enough evidence in March to have said that our souls were playing a role."
6421,Y3zKRHzccMk.mp4,It should have been communicated to the public but why the frustration is the difference between aerosols in Droplet transmission that big and what does this mean for the coronavirus pandemic?
6422,Y3zKRHzccMk.mp4,To start aerosols are tiny respiratory particles that linger in the air.
6423,Y3zKRHzccMk.mp4,They linger longer than droplets which are larger Globs that come from coughing or sneezing aerosols can also transfer at a further distance than the six feet average that droplets effect.
6424,Y3zKRHzccMk.mp4,We spoke to Jose Luis Jimenez a chemistry professor at the University of Colorado older who is currently studying aerosol transmission and covid-19.
6425,Y3zKRHzccMk.mp4,"None of us on droplets are the same material either our saliva or a respiratory fluid, which is the liquid that words, you know knows a respiratory system."
6426,Y3zKRHzccMk.mp4,"Right as we breathe as we talked some of those come out of us and the defense is used their size those droplets are big enough that they could also fly and hit someone in the eye on Industrials or the mouth and the Ready, the virus infection kind of start right away."
6427,Y3zKRHzccMk.mp4,I also shows are both of the same material but there are smaller.
6428,Y3zKRHzccMk.mp4,They can float in the air and it's just like a smoke smoke is another so that we can see so if in fact the person is breathing this pterosaurs in a room that has low ventilation someone else who's breathing the same air is sharing the rumor can get infected over time.
6429,Y3zKRHzccMk.mp4,Aerosols indicate Airborne transmission some experts believe that Airborne transmission has an implicit negative connotation which is why some experts in agencies like the CDC and the World Health Organization are hesitant to believe covid-19 spreads through aerosols.
6430,Y3zKRHzccMk.mp4,We acknowledge that there is emerging evidence in this field.
6431,Y3zKRHzccMk.mp4,And therefore we believe that we have to be open to this evidence and understand.
6432,Y3zKRHzccMk.mp4,"Its implications people are smart and they see the contradiction and they said well, you are a scientist you are telling me the virus is in the air, but the CDC doesn't say that and I trust the CDC more than I trust you as a scientist."
6433,Y3zKRHzccMk.mp4,We need to communicate clearly when you put up a document at the CDC that you have just testified is accurate and then it's changed to suggest that the risk is more minimal by someone for some reason it contributes to the massive confusion.
6434,Y3zKRHzccMk.mp4,That is so so troubling to scientists and so troubling to people While aerosol transmission of covid-19 means that indoor ventilation will be a key factor to protecting against the spread.
6435,Y3zKRHzccMk.mp4,"Dr. Jimenez notes that prevention means sticking with what most scientists like, dr. Anthony found."
6436,Y3zKRHzccMk.mp4,She had been recommending was you go indoors.
6437,Y3zKRHzccMk.mp4,"There's always gonna be some risk besides, you know wearing a good mask what becomes really important is the fit of our crowded places avoid places."
6438,Y3zKRHzccMk.mp4,We learnt Elation speaking US law of a voice as possible.
6439,Y3zKRHzccMk.mp4,And if You Can Do It Outdoors you should do it outdoors and you should give you this.
6440,Y3zKRHzccMk.mp4,People think they're safe in circumstances in which they are not that's the most important thing about the guidance the health agency said that and I think we could really make a big dent in the pandemic.
6441,0Qgrf42mGZ0.mp4,The new coronavirus is still spreading and so a rumors and misinformation about it.
6442,0Qgrf42mGZ0.mp4,"So here's what we know and what we don't know so far the newly identified virus has killed at least a hundred and seventy people in China according to the latest estimates from Chinese State media and more than 7,000 people have been infected worldwide."
6443,0Qgrf42mGZ0.mp4,"The center of the novel coronavirus outbreak is Wuhan in central China, although cases have now been diagnosed in other countries."
6444,0Qgrf42mGZ0.mp4,Coronavirus is the name of the The group this infection belongs to and there are seven known coronavirus has named after their Crown like shape under a microscope.
6445,0Qgrf42mGZ0.mp4,"The tsar's variant infected more than 8,000 people in 2003 and killed 744."
6446,0Qgrf42mGZ0.mp4,So where has it spread to at the moment according to the latest data around seven thousand eight hundred cases have been confirmed so far the vast majority in China more than 50 people have been diagnosed with the virus in 16 countries Chinese.
6447,0Qgrf42mGZ0.mp4,Media has put the death toll at a hundred and seventy so far but no deaths have been reported outside of China yet.
6448,0Qgrf42mGZ0.mp4,"The UK has tested some 97 patients so far for suspected Corona, but no one has been found to have the virus yet."
6449,0Qgrf42mGZ0.mp4,"So as it stands, there are no confirmed cases in Britain how worried should people in the UK be Mark wallhouse who's professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the University of Edinburgh told our fact-check team that the risk is currently Whoa, he said anyone with flu-like symptoms is overwhelmingly more likely to have an ordinary respiratory infection than this new virus that even applies to people with connections with Wuhan, however, the risk is almost certain to increase as the outbreak develops."
6450,0Qgrf42mGZ0.mp4,What is the official advice for travelers to China Public Health bodies in the UK and the United States are both advising against travel to who they Province and the UK government has advised against all but essential travel to the rest of mainland China do UK government.
6451,0Qgrf42mGZ0.mp4,"Is that people should seek medical attention if you have visited Wuhan and develop a fever difficulty breathing or a cop within 14 days the UK Health secretary, Mike Hancock said people who have returned from Wuhan in the last two weeks should self isolate avoiding contact with other people for 14 days, even if they do not have symptoms and the UK government is now preparing to fly some 200 British citizens back from Wuhan and put them in quarantine for two weeks other countries are now doing the same."
6452,0Qgrf42mGZ0.mp4,Including Japan the United States and the EU Australia is planning to quarantine.
6453,0Qgrf42mGZ0.mp4,"It's evacuees on Christmas Island some 1,200 miles off the mainland and this all comes as British Airways have suspended flights to and from mainland China United Airlines and Cathay Pacific are also restricting flights."
6454,0Qgrf42mGZ0.mp4,Should I wear a mask World Health Organization guidelines say healthcare workers treating patients should wear masks goggles surgical gowns and gloves the guidelines say that staff should be Rain to wear masks and other protective equipment as they need to be taken off and disposed of carefully and new ones issued when treating a new patient a number of experts have said there was no need for the general public to wear masks in places where the risk of infection is low the current who infection control advice for the general public does not mention masks or goggles instead focusing on how moshing covering your mouth while sneezing and avoiding raw and undercooked food.
6455,0Qgrf42mGZ0.mp4,Is there a vaccine?
6456,0Qgrf42mGZ0.mp4,No there is currently not a vaccine available for the novel coronavirus despite bogus claims on social media.
6457,0Qgrf42mGZ0.mp4,China's state-run news agency xinhua said scientists in the country have already begun working on a vaccine Western academics have said it may take months or years for a working vaccine to emerge.
6458,0Qgrf42mGZ0.mp4,Is there a cure like SARS?
6459,0Qgrf42mGZ0.mp4,The new coronavirus train has no known cure.
6460,0Qgrf42mGZ0.mp4,Although most cases do not prove fatal and some patients have already recovered and being discharged from hospital.
6461,0Qgrf42mGZ0.mp4,Is it cools by bats?
6462,0Qgrf42mGZ0.mp4,It's not implausible.
6463,0Qgrf42mGZ0.mp4,That wild bats could be the source of a coronavirus epidemic both the SARS outbreak in 2003 and murmurs.
6464,0Qgrf42mGZ0.mp4,"That's the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome in 2012 may have begun in bats like Ebola swine flu and many other infectious diseases coronavirus has are zoonotic which means that they jump from animals to people Chinese researchers have recently published evidence showing that the novel coronavirus closely resembles a similar virus found in bats, but we still simply don't know the source of the original outbreak yet."
6465,0Qgrf42mGZ0.mp4,The Chinese authorities linked early cases to a seafood market in Hunan where exotic wild animals may have been kept in close proximity to each other and sold for food but a new paper published in the Lancet shows that 14 out of 41 patients analyzed by Chinese researchers were not exposed to the seafood market including the first reported case who became ill on December the first last year.
6466,0Qgrf42mGZ0.mp4,"So, what do you think and what questions do you want?"
6467,0Qgrf42mGZ0.mp4,Stirring about the novel coronavirus make sure you subscribe to channel 4 news to get more information and the latest updates on the outbreak.
6468,FC4soCjxSOQ.mp4,The Centers for Disease Control and prevention CDC.
6469,FC4soCjxSOQ.mp4,The expert body on coronavirus has released guidance for general public and Health Care Professionals on the symptoms of the virus a person could be at risk if they have any or all of the following fever and symptoms of lower respiratory illness such as coughing or difficulty breathing after traveling to Wuhan or having close contact with someone who is ill and is now under investigation for the virus in the past two weeks.Eva or symptoms of lower respiratory illness after having close contact in the past two weeks with someone who's been confirmed to have the virus the CDC defined close contact as being within about 6 feet 1.8 meters or within the room or care area of a person with the coronavirus for a prolonged period without appropriate protective clothing or having direct contact with the Infectious secretions of a person with the virus without protective clothing.
6470,FC4soCjxSOQ.mp4,Coronavirus is are particularly dangerous for people who have weaker immune systems like young children and older adults to protect yourself from the virus try to avoid contact with people who display symptoms similar to those of pneumonia or the common cold by coughing or a runny nose.
6471,FC4soCjxSOQ.mp4,Don't touch your eyes nose or mouth with unwashed hands wash your hands frequently with soap and water and scrub for at least 20 seconds use alcohol-based hand.
6472,FC4soCjxSOQ.mp4,Visor when possible avoid animals and animal markets.
6473,FC4soCjxSOQ.mp4,The only current treatment for Coronavirus being offered is supportive in nature.
6474,FC4soCjxSOQ.mp4,"If you notice any of these symptoms and conditions, please contact your nearest professional Healthcare set up help spread this information to everyone."
6475,k8Sc1AktaZk.mp4,Hospitals across Canada are preparing to take in potential patient showing symptoms of the coronavirus here at Humber River Hospital.
6476,k8Sc1AktaZk.mp4,The process of getting admitted looks a little different in that case and it starts at the ambulance Bay.
6477,k8Sc1AktaZk.mp4,"So this is the first place if an ambulance brought somebody and they would come to holds up to six to eight ambulances, but it can be immediately turned in to a pandemic Center."
6478,k8Sc1AktaZk.mp4,It has the ability to have a male and a female side should showers be necessary.
6479,k8Sc1AktaZk.mp4,It's outfitted for shower and water containment if we had a mass pandemic problem.
6480,k8Sc1AktaZk.mp4,We're not anticipating that and needed to we could convert this garage into a containment area once the patient.
6481,k8Sc1AktaZk.mp4,Arrives here.
6482,k8Sc1AktaZk.mp4,What's the next step to the next step with the patient arrives?
6483,k8Sc1AktaZk.mp4,And the ambulance drivers have said the patient requires protection.
6484,k8Sc1AktaZk.mp4,We built a special room right off the ambulance garage and I'll take you and show you that room.
6485,k8Sc1AktaZk.mp4,So this is our isolation has that entrance?
6486,k8Sc1AktaZk.mp4,"And first of all, you will see that it has no soft products in it."
6487,k8Sc1AktaZk.mp4,The floor is hard the walls are hard.
6488,k8Sc1AktaZk.mp4,They'll all Scrabble.
6489,k8Sc1AktaZk.mp4,"What's the importance of this room here importance of this room, is that you stop?"
6490,k8Sc1AktaZk.mp4,Op and you pause you treat in a very safe environment.
6491,k8Sc1AktaZk.mp4,"You determine what you are dealing with the nurses would take the history The Physician has the ability to come and see the patient in this particular room and then from here directly in to our isolation rooms, which are just through this door."
6492,k8Sc1AktaZk.mp4,So this is our acute unit.
6493,k8Sc1AktaZk.mp4,And this is where most of our sickest patients come from come to this is a trauma room at Humber River Hospital and you'll see that it is full of equipment as trauma rooms are the door closes and it automatically becomes negative pressure negative pressure is a system that you you build into your HVAC system and it prevents air from flowing out.
6494,k8Sc1AktaZk.mp4,So the air that might not be that Have a good tablet and it stays within that room where people are properly dressed and property guard to protect themselves.
6495,k8Sc1AktaZk.mp4,So what you have is a gown gloves and a mask with face protection everything she puts on now is because you would have a contamination situation.
6496,k8Sc1AktaZk.mp4,How do you hope people feel when they see this to her and they learn about the facilities that you have here?
6497,k8Sc1AktaZk.mp4,We understand how to protect the public we understand what signs and symptoms to look for.
6498,k8Sc1AktaZk.mp4,We understand all of the different situations.
6499,k8Sc1AktaZk.mp4,We should be asking the patient about to determine whether or not they are a possible contaminated patient.
6500,k8Sc1AktaZk.mp4,And that we are comfortable in knowing how to deal with.
6501,fGfwqBQeDDE.mp4,For more on this let's turn once more to dr. Isaac Bogart infectious disease specialist.
6502,fGfwqBQeDDE.mp4,We've been relying on you for quite some time and we keep hearing doctor that older people or people with compromised immune systems are the ones at risk of getting seriously ill but you listen to a story like that has that changed not really.
6503,fGfwqBQeDDE.mp4,"I mean, I think the dad is still pretty strong that the older people are the greater risk they have for having a more severe outcome in a more severe course of this infection."
6504,fGfwqBQeDDE.mp4,"There's excellent data from Italy from China.Now even emerging from the United States that if we look at the you know, sadly the ultimate outcome of life or death, you know death is overwhelmingly represented in people over the age of 60."
6505,fGfwqBQeDDE.mp4,"Now, of course people over the age of 60 if they get this infection that doesn't mean they're going to succumb to this illness."
6506,fGfwqBQeDDE.mp4,It just means that they're significantly more likely to have a more challenging course compared to younger individuals.
6507,fGfwqBQeDDE.mp4,So should this information though that we're hearing out of the United States for example change.
6508,fGfwqBQeDDE.mp4,What are public health interventions or behavior should be no absolutely not.
6509,fGfwqBQeDDE.mp4,"I think the same rules apply if you're 15, if you're 55, or if you're a hundred and five we've heard about social distancing measures and these are extremely important."
6510,fGfwqBQeDDE.mp4,So people should avoid large Gatherings.
6511,fGfwqBQeDDE.mp4,They should be working from home.
6512,fGfwqBQeDDE.mp4,They should just be spreading apart to really reduce an individual's likelihood of acquiring this infection and also to reduce Transmission in the community.
6513,fGfwqBQeDDE.mp4,Okay.
6514,fGfwqBQeDDE.mp4,Dr. Bowe gosh.
6515,fGfwqBQeDDE.mp4,Thanks again for helping us understand what's going on.
6516,fGfwqBQeDDE.mp4,anytime
6517,GDF7KvNRHA4.mp4,The nature of covid is that we need drugs.
6518,GDF7KvNRHA4.mp4,We need to drugs which we know work and we need them as soon as possible.
6519,GDF7KvNRHA4.mp4,The patients are admitted to hospital with covid.
6520,GDF7KvNRHA4.mp4,Then typically one in five will sadly died.
6521,GDF7KvNRHA4.mp4,So actually saving lives is the key thing we're looking for Recovery child is set up at record speed.
6522,GDF7KvNRHA4.mp4,It had to be we knew it had to be we had to set this trial up within two weeks when we beat that and we'd set it up within nine days.
6523,GDF7KvNRHA4.mp4,That is a speed and scale that has never been matched in any setting.
6524,GDF7KvNRHA4.mp4,Let alone in the context of a pandemic.
6525,GDF7KvNRHA4.mp4,"We're studying four or five drugs simultaneously and as we get enough evidence, that one drug is definitely useful or perhaps not so useful we can stop studying that drug and move on and slotting other drugs as they become available today."
6526,GDF7KvNRHA4.mp4,"There are just over 10,000 patients have enrolled in the clinical trial roughly speaking."
6527,GDF7KvNRHA4.mp4,"That's about 13 or 14 percent of all patients who have been admitted to hospital within the UK, which I think in itself."
6528,GDF7KvNRHA4.mp4,He's something of a record.
6529,GDF7KvNRHA4.mp4,"I mean the collaboration has been colossal from different parts of the system from within the UK the Department of Health for the regulatory agency the mhra from the Ethics Committee from the research infrastructure on the grounds coordinated from the team at University of Oxford, but this is not about any one person or one organization."
6530,GDF7KvNRHA4.mp4,This is about teamwork and that's what matters.
6531,WNxAz17x1n8.mp4,Managing the info to make is a very important and relevant issue country and I was very excited to be part of World Health organization's first conference on info demek.
6532,WNxAz17x1n8.mp4,This is a this particular phenomena is very complex and it requires a multidisciplinary approach which should be realistic in nature.
6533,WNxAz17x1n8.mp4,So it was very reassuring to see that the organization organizers brought together experts from many different fields from the cheeks to anthropology and also Routes put together some practitioners who broke very important been insightful information and perspective to the devil.
6534,WNxAz17x1n8.mp4,I work at the intersection of economics and public health.
6535,WNxAz17x1n8.mp4,So if I believe it is very relevant to the management of infographic.
6536,WNxAz17x1n8.mp4,We really need to understand incentives and motivations for people to Gage this particular particular area and how they contribute to infographic and it is also important for us to understand political economic nature and motivation that full in photographic and overwhelming nature of the information that the year was bombarded with it every day.
6537,WNxAz17x1n8.mp4,So over the course of the conference and groups.
6538,WNxAz17x1n8.mp4,Sessions there II could feel there was a palpable interest to take the discussion forward and take meaningful actions design intervention that will help us to manage infographic rigorous way.
6539,WNxAz17x1n8.mp4,So I hope to be part of the community of practitioners and contribute meaningfully.
6540,WNxAz17x1n8.mp4,These newly emerging field of unforgiving a locking in photonics.
6541,WNxAz17x1n8.mp4,I really want to thank the organization to make me a part of this journey.
6542,WNxAz17x1n8.mp4,Thank you.
6543,a1WFY4moUPQ.mp4,I could not be able to leave my house right now and I'm good for a month easy.
6544,a1WFY4moUPQ.mp4,You don't necessarily have to be like Alex Vezina someone who has a master's degree in Emergency Management.
6545,a1WFY4moUPQ.mp4,I'm a base level of preparedness all the time.
6546,a1WFY4moUPQ.mp4,But as covid-19 continues to spread abroad and more people here in Canada are self isolating for 14 days.
6547,a1WFY4moUPQ.mp4,It may be time to ask yourself you have food.
6548,a1WFY4moUPQ.mp4,Do you have any specific medications that you need to survive?
6549,a1WFY4moUPQ.mp4,"Because if you have a medical condition that requires insulin for diabetes or what have you do you have that you have an arrangement with your doctor in Canada Post or whoever to get it delivered to you in an effort to prevent public Panic Health experts urge Canadians to view the situation in context the right now there isn't covid-19 circulating rampantly through Canada and there is such a thing as being over-prepared and we've seen that for example with masks, you know, and don't use a mask and If you're not feeling symptoms, or if you're not been asked to wear a mask because we need to conserve our supplies with March break coming up."
6550,a1WFY4moUPQ.mp4,A lot of Canadians are really concerned about their travel plans.
6551,a1WFY4moUPQ.mp4,"Wondering if it's safe enough to go if people are going in a Zone in an area in the country, which we already know."
6552,a1WFY4moUPQ.mp4,There is an issue people should really think twice because obviously it's about their health and safety you need to think about that if you or your family member gets sick while you're abroad are you in a country where you're okay?
6553,a1WFY4moUPQ.mp4,Using the Health Care System our health officials say the risk of transmission here remains low and to keep it that way.
6554,a1WFY4moUPQ.mp4,We should be doing the same kinds of things we do to protect ourselves during flu season that's washing our hands avoiding people who are sick and staying home.
6555,a1WFY4moUPQ.mp4,"If you are sick and seeking medical attention when you need it a leash s on CBC News, Toronto"
6556,PQ3HSg2H1qU.mp4,"Francis Wilson, I called earlier this week just to touch base with you all about delivering a shipment of 50 lunches for the new staff."
6557,PQ3HSg2H1qU.mp4,Don't feel a lot better now than I was about stepping out.
6558,PQ3HSg2H1qU.mp4,That's for sure.
6559,PQ3HSg2H1qU.mp4,There are going to be a lot of people who were sick from covid and they're not going to be back to the way they were for bit of time.
6560,PQ3HSg2H1qU.mp4,My first Sometimes showed up March.
6561,PQ3HSg2H1qU.mp4,"Aw, I was just a slight cough."
6562,PQ3HSg2H1qU.mp4,I thought it was allergies cough kind of develops into stomach pains migraine.
6563,PQ3HSg2H1qU.mp4,My respiratory issues to worsened and on the 19th called 911 and they took me into the Virginia Hospital Center.
6564,PQ3HSg2H1qU.mp4,So I was under from the 19th until the 28th and then got extubated late in the evening on the 29th.
6565,PQ3HSg2H1qU.mp4,When I first woke up.
6566,PQ3HSg2H1qU.mp4,They gave me a spirometer and said essentially your this is your ticket out of ICU if you can consistently Reach This 1252 1500 reading on this thing that'll indicate that your oxygen levels are good enough to that.
6567,PQ3HSg2H1qU.mp4,You won't have to be on ventilation or oxygen.
6568,PQ3HSg2H1qU.mp4,So when I First got activated.
6569,PQ3HSg2H1qU.mp4,I did this and I topped out at around 500.
6570,PQ3HSg2H1qU.mp4,So I you know took me a few days to get up to this 1250 range.
6571,PQ3HSg2H1qU.mp4,We're still in the pandemic.
6572,PQ3HSg2H1qU.mp4,So the recovery process is very young and early and a lot of times we measure these things in months six months out a year out and we're not there yet.
6573,PQ3HSg2H1qU.mp4,"So we don't have that kind of data, but we can extrapolate to other diseases that we've seen where this happens and this is similar to the experience that happen with SARS almost 20 years ago is that patients who had severe lung disease from covid similar to the patients had severe lung disease with stars."
6574,PQ3HSg2H1qU.mp4,So their X-rays were quite abnormal during covid and they remained at moral even after coat.
6575,PQ3HSg2H1qU.mp4,Tried to go for a run turn more into a walk.
6576,PQ3HSg2H1qU.mp4,It's just crazy to see how different my lung capacity is from now versus for this all went down here before the started.
6577,PQ3HSg2H1qU.mp4,I was doing three miles and feeling fine.
6578,PQ3HSg2H1qU.mp4,"Now, I made it about half a mile and had to stop when I first got out of the hospital."
6579,PQ3HSg2H1qU.mp4,I went on a walk with my roommate to just a quarter mile down the street to go get groceries on our walk back.
6580,PQ3HSg2H1qU.mp4,I didn't have anything to have you had it.
6581,PQ3HSg2H1qU.mp4,I think orange juice is a freeze pops up.
6582,PQ3HSg2H1qU.mp4,"Nothing too major, but I had to stop three times just to rest persons week."
6583,PQ3HSg2H1qU.mp4,They can't get to the bathroom.
6584,PQ3HSg2H1qU.mp4,They can't go shopping on their own they're worried because they're out of breath searching for the remote control for the TV now that they're home.
6585,PQ3HSg2H1qU.mp4,They Wonder am I?
6586,PQ3HSg2H1qU.mp4,Okay.
6587,PQ3HSg2H1qU.mp4,I was in ICU.
6588,PQ3HSg2H1qU.mp4,I was on the ventilator.
6589,PQ3HSg2H1qU.mp4,This is not normal that I'm short of breath trying to reach for the remote control.
6590,PQ3HSg2H1qU.mp4,And I don't think that they're prepared for that.
6591,PQ3HSg2H1qU.mp4,There are so many things going on.
6592,PQ3HSg2H1qU.mp4,There's the disease itself.
6593,PQ3HSg2H1qU.mp4,There's the ramifications of ICU syndrome.
6594,PQ3HSg2H1qU.mp4,There's also post ICU syndrome and then there's PTSD and these are overlapping circles.
6595,PQ3HSg2H1qU.mp4,I really want to call the dream Lisa Nation whatever it was I experienced dying and Being processed for burial had an out-of-body experience the whole nine yards and then from going from that to a realizing just how close I was to being to actually dying.
6596,PQ3HSg2H1qU.mp4,I mean the nurses also that they didn't expect me to live this past three hours.
6597,PQ3HSg2H1qU.mp4,I just spent reading overall texts.
6598,PQ3HSg2H1qU.mp4,messages from when I was getting sick and going into the hospital.
6599,PQ3HSg2H1qU.mp4,Today's very long and difficult.
6600,PQ3HSg2H1qU.mp4,"I mean, I've definitely been exhibiting PTSD type symptoms."
6601,PQ3HSg2H1qU.mp4,I've been having nightmares pretty consistently all having some sort of covid related theme.
6602,PQ3HSg2H1qU.mp4,I've been I've dreamed that I was dying I dream that I was being buried alive.
6603,PQ3HSg2H1qU.mp4,"I've woken up and jolted awake freaking out because I didn't have my wires in my arm, and I thought that I had, you know, accidentally turn them out while I was asleep."
6604,PQ3HSg2H1qU.mp4,We don't explain to the patient's what to expect.
6605,PQ3HSg2H1qU.mp4,What's normal.
6606,PQ3HSg2H1qU.mp4,We don't talk to them too much about the hallucinations.
6607,PQ3HSg2H1qU.mp4,"It's sometimes even a source of almost embarrassment like we don't want to talk about it, but we should address that you know, while you were here you had several hallucinations of which you're going to remember some were pretty traumatic."
6608,PQ3HSg2H1qU.mp4,"It's not normal to have a lose Nations, but for somebody in your situation, it is normal."
6609,PQ3HSg2H1qU.mp4,Yeah.
6610,PQ3HSg2H1qU.mp4,I will get it to them where you thank you.
6611,PQ3HSg2H1qU.mp4,Stay safe.
6612,PQ3HSg2H1qU.mp4,You too.
6613,PQ3HSg2H1qU.mp4,"Yeah, I'm so happy."
6614,PQ3HSg2H1qU.mp4,It feels good to give back and they saved my life.
6615,PQ3HSg2H1qU.mp4,"So, you know, I'm just glad to be able to do you know some good here now make the best of it."
6616,sFiy4kvRcSs.mp4,Hi everyone.
6617,sFiy4kvRcSs.mp4,My name is Isaac George.
6618,sFiy4kvRcSs.mp4,I'm in the department of surgery.
6619,sFiy4kvRcSs.mp4,I wanted to tell you a little bit about my experience with covid in mid-march.
6620,sFiy4kvRcSs.mp4,I got sick and I recovered and I was going to tell you a little bit about some of the personal aspects to my recovery and how it's affected what I do at work.
6621,sFiy4kvRcSs.mp4,So I'll start off by telling you on Sunday evening and again in mid-march.
6622,sFiy4kvRcSs.mp4,I started to.
6623,sFiy4kvRcSs.mp4,Not feel well.
6624,sFiy4kvRcSs.mp4,I had a mild cough the next day on Monday.
6625,sFiy4kvRcSs.mp4,I felt worse.
6626,sFiy4kvRcSs.mp4,I started to have some some low-grade fevers and that night.
6627,sFiy4kvRcSs.mp4,I actually ended up sleeping on the couch Tuesday morning.
6628,sFiy4kvRcSs.mp4,I definitely knew something was wrong.
6629,sFiy4kvRcSs.mp4,I had fevers they were up to 101.
6630,sFiy4kvRcSs.mp4,I had severe myalgias I was tired and I really just didn't want to move around.
6631,sFiy4kvRcSs.mp4,I didn't really have a cough but I had headaches and I don't really get headaches and they were Double headaches pretty severe.
6632,sFiy4kvRcSs.mp4,So I knew something was wrong.
6633,sFiy4kvRcSs.mp4,I was lucky enough to get tested at a local facility just across the street from my apartment and I actually took all my things and I left our apartment.
6634,sFiy4kvRcSs.mp4,I left my family and I was lucky enough to have an apartment available our in-laws apartment and they were not there and so I was able to go to my in-laws apartment and I stayed there so over the next three to four days.
6635,sFiy4kvRcSs.mp4,I was waiting for the test to come back.
6636,sFiy4kvRcSs.mp4,"I You to have fevers low-grade that was you know, somewhat controlled with Tylenol."
6637,sFiy4kvRcSs.mp4,I continue to have myalgias and I just didn't want to move around.
6638,sFiy4kvRcSs.mp4,I didn't really feel like eating much.
6639,sFiy4kvRcSs.mp4,I slept a lot.
6640,sFiy4kvRcSs.mp4,I had headaches and everything seemed to slowly get better after 3 to 4 days.
6641,sFiy4kvRcSs.mp4,I had some mild GI distress.
6642,sFiy4kvRcSs.mp4,"It was a little bit of a slow recovery, but it certainly wasn't as severe as some of the cases that we're seeing in the hospital obviously and it was But I would consider clearly a mild case of covid but it did take some energy out of you and I did lose, you know, five to seven pounds, which is a lot for me and overall."
6643,sFiy4kvRcSs.mp4,It did get better the test came back positive after about a week or so.
6644,sFiy4kvRcSs.mp4,I felt significantly better and I made the decision to come back home at that point in wearing a mask at home and keeping it again keeping isolated from my family to some extent.
6645,sFiy4kvRcSs.mp4,At that time the recommendation was you could come back to work if you're asymptomatic and not having fevers my spend an extra week out of work at the time.
6646,sFiy4kvRcSs.mp4,It was not that busy and so I felt that it was reasonable to stay stay home.
6647,sFiy4kvRcSs.mp4,And after two weeks.
6648,sFiy4kvRcSs.mp4,I came back to work in terms of how this has changed what I do in the hospital.
6649,sFiy4kvRcSs.mp4,We've had a significant reduction in cardiac surgery.
6650,sFiy4kvRcSs.mp4,So it's not as if we've been busy busy with operating a As point so it's been a different situation for us.
6651,sFiy4kvRcSs.mp4,I've been working in the ICU taking care of covid patients and our new icus and that's taken up the majority of my time.
6652,sFiy4kvRcSs.mp4,And then the rest of the time we've been working on academic projects.
6653,sFiy4kvRcSs.mp4,I felt well and I feel totally back to normal at this point.
6654,sFiy4kvRcSs.mp4,And you know in terms of the energy that's come back.
6655,sFiy4kvRcSs.mp4,I've gone running before and it's maybe not as good as it used to be but it's closed.
6656,sFiy4kvRcSs.mp4,"I have used the same precautions that I've had before, you know, having recovered doesn't necessarily mean that you're immune I have gotten tested and I do have antibodies."
6657,sFiy4kvRcSs.mp4,"But again, I think we're still trying to figure out what kind of immune or do you really have what these?"
6658,sFiy4kvRcSs.mp4,Base and it's not clear.
6659,sFiy4kvRcSs.mp4,"If you can get another infection again, or the the length of immunity with the antibody."
6660,sFiy4kvRcSs.mp4,So regardless I keep with full recommendations and I wear all of the PPE that we need to for taking care of patients to some extent.
6661,sFiy4kvRcSs.mp4,I think it's allowed me to have a little bit more freedom and I you know very it's been important for me to come back to work to give me something to do one as well as to ensure that that may be other providers who may be at higher risk don't necessarily need to come into the hospital.
6662,sFiy4kvRcSs.mp4,I understand that we've had a lot of people who've been really sick.
6663,sFiy4kvRcSs.mp4,"Some of our colleagues have been extremely sick and it's important for us to understand that in terms of how bad it was, you know, it was worse than the flu."
6664,sFiy4kvRcSs.mp4,"It was probably along the lines of the worst flu that I've had but just for you know, four days four to five days and really after the To six day."
6665,sFiy4kvRcSs.mp4,I got better and so it lasted a week and I've had the flu which is lasted more than a week and I've had sinus infections that have that have been worse.
6666,sFiy4kvRcSs.mp4,So in a scale of one to ten I would say it was a seven to eight.
6667,sFiy4kvRcSs.mp4,And so I think that's the majority of the cases that are out there probably 70 to 80% of the cases that are out there are similar to mine or maybe even a symptomatic complete.
6668,sFiy4kvRcSs.mp4,I'm very again grateful and lucky to be in the position that I'm in.
6669,egTjSAP-S6U.mp4,"Joe Biden back on the campaign Trail Friday afternoon mixing prayer politics and Public Health in Battleground, Michigan."
6670,egTjSAP-S6U.mp4,I'd like to start by acknowledging which I'm sure all of you do as well sending my prayers for the health and safety of the first lady and president president United States.
6671,egTjSAP-S6U.mp4,"We can say 100,000 lives in the next 100 days according to the head of the CDC if everyone wears a mask in public The Biden campaign canceling a second indoor event in Michigan out of an abundance of caution across the country Biden's running mate Kamala Harris holding a drive-up rally in Las Vegas and an online fundraiser with former President Obama."
6672,egTjSAP-S6U.mp4,It's important I think for all of us to remember that even when we're in the midst of big political battles with issues that have a lot at stake that Real Americans and we're all human beings and that we we want to make sure that everybody is healthy.

6675,egTjSAP-S6U.mp4,What was your reaction when you heard about his positive test today?
6676,egTjSAP-S6U.mp4,Thought it was cool.
6677,egTjSAP-S6U.mp4,Like justice because he has been mocking the mask-wearing.
6678,egTjSAP-S6U.mp4,He even did it on the debate.
6679,egTjSAP-S6U.mp4,I think he'll pull through it and I don't think it's going to affect the campaign.
6680,egTjSAP-S6U.mp4,Biden has several campaign surrogates on the trail for him this weekend.

6688,mHuiYAPoEw0.mp4,And what I'm going to do is I'm actually the first person.
6689,mHuiYAPoEw0.mp4,So for a nasopharyngeal swab you're going to feel my hands back here in the back of your head of you.
6690,mHuiYAPoEw0.mp4,Lay your head back.
6691,mHuiYAPoEw0.mp4,You can blow out through your nose we're going to do is we're going to insert the swab inside of the nostril and then we're going to point it a little bit mediately and post immediately and posteriorly.
6692,mHuiYAPoEw0.mp4,"Okay, you can exhale through your nose if you like it."
6693,mHuiYAPoEw0.mp4,That'll make you feel better.
6694,mHuiYAPoEw0.mp4,"Okay, keep on breathing keep on breathing."
6695,mHuiYAPoEw0.mp4,You're doing a great job.
6696,mHuiYAPoEw0.mp4,You're doing great.
6697,mHuiYAPoEw0.mp4,We're almost done.
6698,mHuiYAPoEw0.mp4,You're doing great.
6699,mHuiYAPoEw0.mp4,"Okay, and that's it."
6700,mHuiYAPoEw0.mp4,And we're done.
6701,mHuiYAPoEw0.mp4,Thank you so much.
6702,mHuiYAPoEw0.mp4,What's that experience?
6703,mHuiYAPoEw0.mp4,Looks like your eyes are a little bit better.
6704,mHuiYAPoEw0.mp4,It's uncomfortable.
6705,mHuiYAPoEw0.mp4,Remember you if you have to have it done.
6706,mHuiYAPoEw0.mp4,So it basically makes your eyes water and does is it painful at all?
6707,mHuiYAPoEw0.mp4,It's uncomfortable.
6708,mHuiYAPoEw0.mp4,"Well, I was like getting a shot."
6709,mHuiYAPoEw0.mp4,shot
6710,rUiSetIuQAU.mp4,Look down isn't a strategy.
6711,rUiSetIuQAU.mp4,It's a delaying action.
6712,rUiSetIuQAU.mp4,"The question is how much time will this look down by us simplify this right down think of it like a tug of war between two forces social distancing and the growth of the virus lockdown Powers up Social distancing, but we're not doing it completely and fifty thousand people a day it catching the virus in the UK."
6713,rUiSetIuQAU.mp4,So the virus is still strong.
6714,rUiSetIuQAU.mp4,"You can see this in action if you look at the first of lockdowns, Last time around the UK delayed so growth was high when we went in France lockdown earlier and with stricter measures, so it's locked down with shorter ours which one of the longest in Europe you can see this with Scotland Wales Northern Ireland Maybe This Time."
6715,rUiSetIuQAU.mp4,England has delayed will we see the same effect?
6716,rUiSetIuQAU.mp4,"We do actually have a scientific assessment of the impact of lockdowns not for a month, but for the two weeks circuit breaker suggested by Satan September they analyzed what a two-week lockdown over the October half-term would do to Hospital admissions."
6717,rUiSetIuQAU.mp4,The white line here is what would happen in that with no intervention and all these are different scenarios like moderate strict total and this of course total being what we had back in April two things are true of all these scenarios first no matter what happens.
6718,rUiSetIuQAU.mp4,It takes some time to have an effect.
6719,rUiSetIuQAU.mp4,Look hospitalizations keep on growing even after lockdown as come in second.
6720,rUiSetIuQAU.mp4,And under all these scenarios Hospital admissions bounced back really very quickly in the strictest.
6721,rUiSetIuQAU.mp4,Scenario.
6722,rUiSetIuQAU.mp4,"This blue one total lockdown takes about six weeks in the second strictest, which is roughly comparable to our one takes about four weeks."
6723,rUiSetIuQAU.mp4,We're in lockdown for longer.
6724,rUiSetIuQAU.mp4,So we'll get a longer grace period but eventually the virus will come roaring back.
6725,rUiSetIuQAU.mp4,That's why the question for the government is how will we use this time?
6726,rUiSetIuQAU.mp4,We've bought and for All of us can we change our Behavior to stop lockdowns three and even four?
6727,czq2z3NgxpM.mp4,Those coronavirus spreads to more countries.
6728,czq2z3NgxpM.mp4,It's threatening the health of the global economy.
6729,czq2z3NgxpM.mp4,"It's one of the worst weeks for the Dow since the 2008 financial crisis and we hit the streets to ask how worried you are about covid-19 s impact on the economy it all about the effect coronavirus is having on the economy, you know as a stock investor anytime."
6730,czq2z3NgxpM.mp4,"You see it go down 20% your kind of Happiness weird sensor like yes that can invest, you know, buy everything sheAt the same time, you know as someone who works at 9:00 to 5:00 job."
6731,czq2z3NgxpM.mp4,"You're like, oh Now's the Time where like people are going to start getting layoffs and everything of that."
6732,czq2z3NgxpM.mp4,I don't think so.
6733,czq2z3NgxpM.mp4,I don't know if it will like get to a point where it will affect it that much worried at all about the effect on the economy.
6734,czq2z3NgxpM.mp4,"Oh, I'm actually kind of worried."
6735,czq2z3NgxpM.mp4,"Yeah because it could shut down like Global Supply chains right mean we're so interior intertwined either interconnected, you know with the whole world is and thanks to everyone who stopped to chat."
6736,czq2z3NgxpM.mp4,The other day.
6737,czq2z3NgxpM.mp4,So for more on the impact is that break is having on Canada's economy.
6738,czq2z3NgxpM.mp4,"We've reached Pedro on Tunas now, he is the chief Economist at the conference Board of Canada not-for-profit Think Tank and he joins us from Ottawa Pedro."
6739,czq2z3NgxpM.mp4,Thanks so much for your time.
6740,czq2z3NgxpM.mp4,Especially early on a weekend morning Canadian markets took a tumble this week.
6741,czq2z3NgxpM.mp4,How concerned are you about the fact that the covid virus continues to spread and what effect it might be having on the economy.
6742,czq2z3NgxpM.mp4,"Well, I think some of the some of the interviews I was here with the audience."
6743,czq2z3NgxpM.mp4,There were right on I think the issue here.
6744,czq2z3NgxpM.mp4,Of course is that the first the first country affected was China and China is a huge country.
6745,czq2z3NgxpM.mp4,"Now, it's a global power in terms of its consumer spending."
6746,czq2z3NgxpM.mp4,And so we're already seeing some implications of that and we've heard about the Chinese that are the number number one outbound travel market.
6747,czq2z3NgxpM.mp4,So that's having an impact certainly on global tourism.
6748,czq2z3NgxpM.mp4,And on top of that.
6749,czq2z3NgxpM.mp4,"Of course, there's the supply chain."
6750,czq2z3NgxpM.mp4,In fact that some rule dude.
6751,czq2z3NgxpM.mp4,You too.
6752,czq2z3NgxpM.mp4,So just that hoobae Province for example is the it produces 50% of LCD screens in the world.
6753,czq2z3NgxpM.mp4,"So you can imagine that if you know in the supply chains, these things are starting to be to be felt but more broadly now is that this the virus is spreading outside of China and the concern there is how how far does this go before we do contain it and it is going to have impacts across the world."
6754,czq2z3NgxpM.mp4,"Let's try and unpack some of that you talk about supply chain talk about Flat screens and other things but presumably Canadian consumers and even a lot of Canadian manufacturers may not be fully aware of how much of the bits and bytes of their finished product actually starts out in China, right?"
6755,czq2z3NgxpM.mp4,"Well, in fact, yes, a lot of Manufacturers don't know how deep their supply chains run."
6756,czq2z3NgxpM.mp4,We do know that we're very much integrated within North America.
6757,czq2z3NgxpM.mp4,"So we tend to look South when we think about Supply chains, but we cannot ignore that in terms of chemical."
6758,czq2z3NgxpM.mp4,"Flies in terms of some of these parts for electronics in terms of some of the minerals even a lot of this does come from China and from other parts of the world, so we're not immune to that and I think you know, just when we think about China as a the biggest the second biggest economy in the world, you know, this is going to have an impact globally which will have repercussions for Canada, you know, we're exporting economy."
6759,czq2z3NgxpM.mp4,We depend on the global economy.
6760,czq2z3NgxpM.mp4,So this is going to have further impacts.
6761,czq2z3NgxpM.mp4,We certainly saw some effects.
6762,czq2z3NgxpM.mp4,"The stock market, although many have pointed out that maybe there was some froth that needed to be taken off the top anyway, and that would have happened it at some point."
6763,czq2z3NgxpM.mp4,"But in terms of the effect on Canadian consumers, how long do you think it'll be before that effect is palpable."
6764,czq2z3NgxpM.mp4,"You know, it's well, I mean we in Canada were lucky we came off a very good year for employment in 2019 wages are pretty healthy or growing fairly strongly."
6765,czq2z3NgxpM.mp4,"So in terms of the income signed, you know, we're in pretty good shape heading into this the problem."
6766,czq2z3NgxpM.mp4,Is that the kind of Fear Factor and this is something that economists and many others have become very aware of since the 2008-2009 recession The Fear Factor can have huge implications for consumer confidence business confidence and that can play itself out now.
6767,czq2z3NgxpM.mp4,Remind people that these types of viral kinds of kind of global viral infections in the past.
6768,czq2z3NgxpM.mp4,They have been followed by a big rebound.
6769,czq2z3NgxpM.mp4,So hopefully we'll be able to contain this before it has a too much further reach and we hopefully will see that similar kind of pattern rebounding and consumer spending etcetera when people do finally breathe easier about the virus until we get to that rebound.
6770,czq2z3NgxpM.mp4,Is there anything that the government could or should do to potentially Ali Stave off some of those ill effects.
6771,czq2z3NgxpM.mp4,"Well, I think right now from this is a Health crisis and I think government should really focus on that."
6772,czq2z3NgxpM.mp4,"I think with respect to the the the economy I think people should have we should try and have as much common sense about avoiding too much travel avoiding going to places where there are contagion and as individuals, I think you know health health officials would tell you stay home if you're not feeling so good and hopefully, you know, we won't see this take bite."
6773,czq2z3NgxpM.mp4,Here in this country Pedro.
6774,czq2z3NgxpM.mp4,Thank you so much for your help.
6775,czq2z3NgxpM.mp4,Really?
6776,czq2z3NgxpM.mp4,Appreciate it.
6777,czq2z3NgxpM.mp4,You're welcome to pleasure Peter on tuna.
6778,czq2z3NgxpM.mp4,This is the chief Economist with the conference Board of Canada.
6779,dNmk_sL-xyo.mp4,Contact tracing is a tool that works for infectious diseases.
6780,dNmk_sL-xyo.mp4,It will work for covid-19.
6781,dNmk_sL-xyo.mp4,It's worked in the past and it's worked with other countries.
6782,dNmk_sL-xyo.mp4,So we know how to do this.
6783,dNmk_sL-xyo.mp4,We just need to scale it up and make it a priority for our country.
6784,dNmk_sL-xyo.mp4,And this is how we're going to get this pandemic under control.
6785,dNmk_sL-xyo.mp4,"The purpose of contact tracing is to break chains of transmission, which means you find that infected person you identify their contacts you ask them to quarantine at home and then they're not out in the community spreading the virus if they are infected that stops transmission."
6786,dNmk_sL-xyo.mp4,Their contact tracing is a very well-used public health intervention.
6787,dNmk_sL-xyo.mp4,We've used this for many decades to identify cases and track her contacts for diseases like sexually Transmitted infections and measles and tuberculosis when we lift the social distancing measures and if we don't have a robust contact tracing capability and place what we're going to see is a Resurgence of this virus.
6788,dNmk_sL-xyo.mp4,So we will see big surges of cases.
6789,dNmk_sL-xyo.mp4,We will see recurring epidemics and locations without these tools in place.
6790,dNmk_sL-xyo.mp4,For covid-19.
6791,dNmk_sL-xyo.mp4,The reproductive number is between two and three.
6792,dNmk_sL-xyo.mp4,So each person with this infection on average passes it along to two to three other people.
6793,dNmk_sL-xyo.mp4,What we're trying to do is bring that reproductive number down below 1 so that would mean on average each person infected with the virus infects fewer than one other person and that's when we can manage this pandemic effectively because we don't have that ongoing.
6794,dNmk_sL-xyo.mp4,spread and exponential growth in the cases
6795,jgGdQkXJENA.mp4,"It's um sometime what is a coronavirus it is an alien, which is hunting all of us."
6796,jgGdQkXJENA.mp4,"Oh, um some coronavirus has are a large family of viruses."
6797,jgGdQkXJENA.mp4,They're found in animals as well as humans.
6798,jgGdQkXJENA.mp4,"Some of them are known to infect people and cause illnesses such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome as in Merce and severe acute respiratory syndrome as in SARS novel coronavirus or 2019 - n Co V is a new strain of coronavirus, which was first detected in Wuhan China in December."
6799,jgGdQkXJENA.mp4,2019 the disease caused by novel coronavirus is named as C OV ID - 19 here.
6800,jgGdQkXJENA.mp4,Co and VI are taken from the word Coronavirus.
6801,jgGdQkXJENA.mp4,While deep stands for disease and 19 stands for year 2019 some people might suffer from mild symptoms like runny nose sore throat cough and fever because of the virus while some might experience severe symptoms leading to pneumonia for some people.
6802,jgGdQkXJENA.mp4,This disease has also proven to be fatal research is still on but the animal source of the novel coronavirus has not yet been identified topic.
6803,jgGdQkXJENA.mp4,pneumonia What causes pneumonia?
6804,jgGdQkXJENA.mp4,The letter P na pneumonia is a lung infection caused by microorganisms which generally leads to difficulty in breathing.
6805,jgGdQkXJENA.mp4,Normally we inhale oxygen rich air which reaches our alveoli alveoli are surrounded by Blood capillaries.
6806,jgGdQkXJENA.mp4,Oh here the oxygen through the walls of alveoli diffuses into our blood.
6807,jgGdQkXJENA.mp4,"However, sometimes we also want hail harmful microorganisms, mostly the Cilia and mucus in our respiratory tract trap these microorganisms which are then expelled while coffin but sometimes the microorganisms don't get trapped into reach the alveoli."
6808,jgGdQkXJENA.mp4,There they start to multiply causing lung infection.
6809,jgGdQkXJENA.mp4,That is pneumonia.
6810,jgGdQkXJENA.mp4,"Oh, no."
6811,jgGdQkXJENA.mp4,Now what do we do now to protect ourselves the immune cells start attacking the microorganisms causing inflammation and accumulation of fluid in the alveoli as a result.
6812,jgGdQkXJENA.mp4,The inhaled oxygen cannot get easily diffused into blood thus causing difficulty in breathing.
6813,jgGdQkXJENA.mp4,Why is it hard to hear common cold?
6814,jgGdQkXJENA.mp4,Cuz common cold wears an invisibility cloak?
6815,jgGdQkXJENA.mp4,"No, huh?"
6816,jgGdQkXJENA.mp4,"Firstly, there are more than 200 viruses which cause common cold now developing 200 vaccines for 200 viruses is Impractical secondly developing a single vaccine for all 200 viruses is proving to be complex time-consuming and expensive as a lot of R&D is required."
6817,jgGdQkXJENA.mp4,"Lee we can't make antivirals to kill viruses just like we make antibiotics to kill bacteria why because antibiotics attack the bacteria's protective cell walls, but as viruses don't have any cell wall antivirals will be useless."
6818,jgGdQkXJENA.mp4,"However, there might be some good news now virus survives in human body by hijacking a protein found in human cells researchers have developed a compound which inhibits the virus from doing so but as the compound argit's human cells more research is needed to test its safety."
6819,jgGdQkXJENA.mp4,Should we work out when we have cold we should just chill and have milk shakes you wish.
6820,jgGdQkXJENA.mp4,Yes one may work out but for shorten duration and with reduced intensity of symptoms are above the neck as in common cold stuffy nose sneezing or jaw pain as the symptoms are minor one can take appropriate hole related medicines and then put in my Whole exercise with proper care note that light or moderate physical activity may help open up the nasal passageway.
6821,jgGdQkXJENA.mp4,Thus helping us feel better.
6822,jgGdQkXJENA.mp4,"But on the flip side, there is a chance of spreading germs or viruses to others."
6823,jgGdQkXJENA.mp4,On the other hand if the symptoms are below the neck as in Fever vomiting coughs shortness of breath etcetera.
6824,jgGdQkXJENA.mp4,Then one should not exercise.
6825,jgGdQkXJENA.mp4,Our body needs rest in this case.
6826,jgGdQkXJENA.mp4,Hence one should not overwork as it will make it difficult to recover and may also lead to fatigue or dizziness.
6827,LbrSZXqLUok.mp4,My husband and I are going to travel at West so I would like to be sure that I don't have anything.
6828,LbrSZXqLUok.mp4,I have young children and family with my mother-in-law who was elderlies.
6829,LbrSZXqLUok.mp4,We just want to make sure that we covered all our bases.
6830,LbrSZXqLUok.mp4,"Yeah, perfect."
6831,LbrSZXqLUok.mp4,It doesn't feel very good when they turn in the swab up there.
6832,LbrSZXqLUok.mp4,"It's kind of like Walnut and gag you my eyes are all watering, but it's worth it.In the fight in the fear around covid-19."
6833,LbrSZXqLUok.mp4,This is a place where truth is uncovered.
6834,LbrSZXqLUok.mp4,Aaron Churchill is a nurse practitioner you doubled up I know yet.
6835,LbrSZXqLUok.mp4,It's double gloves for dr. Karen Euler because she could come in close contact with the deadly disease.
6836,LbrSZXqLUok.mp4,The people who worried they might have it.
6837,LbrSZXqLUok.mp4,Ready to go like this woman who walks up the drive-through is their shift begins.
6838,LbrSZXqLUok.mp4,Sometimes we get people that come by foot.
6839,LbrSZXqLUok.mp4,I'm dr. Euler first.
6840,LbrSZXqLUok.mp4,I'm going to take your oxygen your heart rate and your temperature.
6841,LbrSZXqLUok.mp4,Okay?
6842,LbrSZXqLUok.mp4,Okay.
6843,LbrSZXqLUok.mp4,Sounds good.
6844,LbrSZXqLUok.mp4,Sorry heart rate a hundred and nine.
6845,LbrSZXqLUok.mp4,Are you a little bit nervous a little?
6846,LbrSZXqLUok.mp4,Yeah.
6847,LbrSZXqLUok.mp4,I had these yesterday.
6848,LbrSZXqLUok.mp4,I had a seizure.
6849,LbrSZXqLUok.mp4,Okay.
6850,LbrSZXqLUok.mp4,Well the first time in my life these bruises are from her fall.
6851,LbrSZXqLUok.mp4,Could have seizure be a result of covid.
6852,LbrSZXqLUok.mp4,I've been sweating myself.
6853,LbrSZXqLUok.mp4,So I know the fear of having to sit and wait for a test and every time you feel a sniffle or you feel a chill you think oh my goodness.
6854,LbrSZXqLUok.mp4,Maybe I've got it now.
6855,LbrSZXqLUok.mp4,He's just tilt your head back a little bit.
6856,LbrSZXqLUok.mp4,Her moment of discomfort could uncover a lot.
6857,LbrSZXqLUok.mp4,Good job.
6858,LbrSZXqLUok.mp4,You can use your female.
6859,LbrSZXqLUok.mp4,"Oh, jeez."
6860,LbrSZXqLUok.mp4,Okay.
6861,LbrSZXqLUok.mp4,You can access your results online.
6862,LbrSZXqLUok.mp4,"Okay, if you're positive public health will also call you can take two to five days to get the results."
6863,LbrSZXqLUok.mp4,Martha I'm Jonathan Gatehouse from the CBC.
6864,LbrSZXqLUok.mp4,Can I ask you what brought you out here today?
6865,LbrSZXqLUok.mp4,Why?
6866,LbrSZXqLUok.mp4,Why do you need to get tested?
6867,LbrSZXqLUok.mp4,"Yeah, I got a sore throat a week and a half ago."
6868,LbrSZXqLUok.mp4,We all have a reasons for wanting a test.
6869,LbrSZXqLUok.mp4,Take Martha bull my sister and I live together and my niece.
6870,LbrSZXqLUok.mp4,Who's 50th and is quite compromised?
6871,LbrSZXqLUok.mp4,That's that's what you're hoping to hear.
6872,LbrSZXqLUok.mp4,I guess in that sense of getting that certainty of.
6873,LbrSZXqLUok.mp4,Looking after people as well as yourself be happy to know that it's not cold as that.
6874,LbrSZXqLUok.mp4,I can stop wearing a mask in my own house.
6875,LbrSZXqLUok.mp4,"We saw a lot of people at the beginning that I'm sure were positive, but we didn't test them right."
6876,LbrSZXqLUok.mp4,We only tested healthcare workers and those who are were critically ill.
6877,LbrSZXqLUok.mp4,So we're they positive probably Now with the swab we should swab everybody and that's pretty much what's happening here.
6878,LbrSZXqLUok.mp4,Almost everyone who wants to get tested can all you need are symptoms in an appointment.
6879,LbrSZXqLUok.mp4,Yeah.
6880,LbrSZXqLUok.mp4,We have a huge catchment area to right today.
6881,LbrSZXqLUok.mp4,"It's 46 people the more swab the better instead of just sitting at home and wondering which causes anxiety and I want to get a result right then, you know where you're at so far about 1,500 tests have been done in Collingwood with around 30 positive results."
6882,LbrSZXqLUok.mp4,But for the most part right almost everybody that you're going to see today or tomorrow or any other day don't actually have covid-19.
6883,LbrSZXqLUok.mp4,That's correct.
6884,LbrSZXqLUok.mp4,And the more people we check symptomatic asymptomatic the more we can contain the virus in this province is open up perhaps give confidence to Canadians as they face the threat they've been told to fear.
6885,LbrSZXqLUok.mp4,Summer.
6886,LbrSZXqLUok.mp4,I just want to ask on a scale of 1 to 10.
6887,LbrSZXqLUok.mp4,How bad was it?
6888,LbrSZXqLUok.mp4,"I feel like I'm safe, you know is that it was a be at my nose a bit what it was like I felt safe Martha will have an answer in a couple of days."
6889,LbrSZXqLUok.mp4,But even then her results are just a snapshot of One Moment In Time.
6890,LbrSZXqLUok.mp4,Where do you think you might have got it if you if you do have covid I am completely Stumping Health officials to thank you for being here.
6891,LbrSZXqLUok.mp4,Take care.
6892,LbrSZXqLUok.mp4,That's testing is part of the puzzle.
6893,LbrSZXqLUok.mp4,But at the current rate it would take years to test every Canadian from where do you stand doing this job?
6894,LbrSZXqLUok.mp4,I mean is that even possible in all likelihood?
6895,LbrSZXqLUok.mp4,Probably not but I like to think that if you wanted a test or you worn to test because your symptomatic that you should be able to get a test looks like you got a customer here.
6896,LbrSZXqLUok.mp4,Getting tested is an optional for these guys Logan Crawley and Jamie vo you need a clean bill of health before they can get back to work at a long-term care home.
6897,LbrSZXqLUok.mp4,I understand that you were both did test positive.
6898,LbrSZXqLUok.mp4,Yeah.
6899,LbrSZXqLUok.mp4,"And did you have any symptoms or yes, I have like night sweats."
6900,LbrSZXqLUok.mp4,So like fever strip the night headaches chills.
6901,LbrSZXqLUok.mp4,How long ago was that?
6902,LbrSZXqLUok.mp4,Probably week and a half ago now 36 9 Do you know if you passed it on to anyone else my family?
6903,LbrSZXqLUok.mp4,Everyone's doing okay my dad it's a little like worrying like even like just like trying to remember like who he's been with and who have you talked with?
6904,LbrSZXqLUok.mp4,"Okay, so they'll be back tomorrow era."
6905,LbrSZXqLUok.mp4,"Oh, yeah."
6906,LbrSZXqLUok.mp4,Okay.
6907,LbrSZXqLUok.mp4,Take care guys.
6908,LbrSZXqLUok.mp4,"It turns out they're both still positive will be tested again in a few days Jonathan Gatehouse CBC News, Collingwood, Ontario."
6909,sHP0UIdZyI4.mp4,"So the whole family of coronavirus is are named coronavirus because Corona means crown and so this refers to the way that the virus looks under the microscope, like there's a crown on the top of the virus some of them four or five different kinds cause common diseases among humans everything from the common cold to mild or moderate respiratory illnesses."
6910,sHP0UIdZyI4.mp4,Has other kinds of coronavirus has affect animals and sometimes on rare occasions.
6911,sHP0UIdZyI4.mp4,We see coronavirus has jump from animal species into the human population.
6912,sHP0UIdZyI4.mp4,The 2019 novel coronavirus is getting a lot of attention now because it is a new kind of coronavirus.
6913,sHP0UIdZyI4.mp4,We haven't seen among humans before.
6914,sHP0UIdZyI4.mp4,The theory is that it may have jumped from an animal species into the human population and then begun spreading we have seen some people that have died of this disease and we know that there are already thousands of cases.
6915,sHP0UIdZyI4.mp4,So people are concerned because we don't yet know exactly how severe the disease will be or how far it will spread.
6916,sHP0UIdZyI4.mp4,When a new virus emerges we often have to learn much more about it.
6917,sHP0UIdZyI4.mp4,"And one of the things that we question is, how does it transmitted from person to person we know that most respiratory viruses are spread by large droplets that come out when people cough and sneeze and stay aloft usually for about 6 feet in front of them they land on surfaces and then can also be transmitted between person to person by touching those surfaces such as doorknobs or other surfaces."
6918,sHP0UIdZyI4.mp4,Other viruses can spread in the air and stay aloft for a longer period of time in small droplet nuclei for this current 2019.
6919,sHP0UIdZyI4.mp4,Coronavirus were not yet sure whether it is droplet or Airborne transmission.
6920,sHP0UIdZyI4.mp4,So we're airing on the side of caution and taking protection as if it was spread by the Airborne route.
6921,sHP0UIdZyI4.mp4,We're still learning a lot about this 2019 novel coronavirus to understand how dangerous it might be right.
6922,sHP0UIdZyI4.mp4,Now.
6923,sHP0UIdZyI4.mp4,The majority of the cases are in China.
6924,sHP0UIdZyI4.mp4,We know that some Travelers have brought the virus to other countries including the United States.
6925,sHP0UIdZyI4.mp4,"I think one of the main things to keep in mind is that this is respiratory virus season, and we have other respiratory viruses like influenza that we need to take precautions because we know we have In two cases and thousands of deaths in this country every year from influenza."
6926,sHP0UIdZyI4.mp4,Given the ongoing transmission of the virus in China.
6927,sHP0UIdZyI4.mp4,We have a travel alert that was issued by the Centers for Disease Control and prevention.
6928,sHP0UIdZyI4.mp4,So at this time until we know more avoid non-essential travel to China.
6929,sHP0UIdZyI4.mp4,Johns Hopkins Health System and Health Systems Across the Nation are busy right now preparing to safely identify isolate evaluate and care for patients with 2019 novel coronavirus.
6930,sHP0UIdZyI4.mp4,We have the capability of doing this safely by utilizing personal protective equipment by implementing travel screening so that we can quickly identify patients who have risk factors for the disease and then implementing isolation precautions the It's a personal protective equipment and other measures to make sure that we limit the spread of the virus.
6931,sHP0UIdZyI4.mp4,At the Johns Hopkins Hospital and throughout our health system.
6932,sHP0UIdZyI4.mp4,We routinely care for patients infected with diseases that are spread by the Airborne route.
6933,sHP0UIdZyI4.mp4,So we have expertise to do this safely.
6934,sHP0UIdZyI4.mp4,When a new virus comes along that has unknown risks.
6935,sHP0UIdZyI4.mp4,We have extra measures that we can put in place including our biocontainment unit that can advise us and put plans in place to safely care for these patients.
6936,BU2Ogt_BCxQ.mp4,One of the things that's remarkable about the coronavirus vaccine effort is that modern Technologies are being used like RNA and it's moving faster than ever before.
6937,BU2Ogt_BCxQ.mp4,"So in this study, we will be examining for different variations of a mRNA vaccine messenger."
6938,BU2Ogt_BCxQ.mp4,RNA is a natural substance in the body.
6939,BU2Ogt_BCxQ.mp4,It's actually the genetic instruction to our cells to make New proteins we've had an amazing response from potential participants or volunteers for our human vaccine research studies.
6940,BU2Ogt_BCxQ.mp4,So there's great Community interest in being a part of the solution and I think people are motivated in most cases by altruism.
6941,BU2Ogt_BCxQ.mp4,They just want to help I heard about it through my husband.
6942,BU2Ogt_BCxQ.mp4,"He forwarded the email to me about information about the study and I thought oh gosh, this is a no-brainer."
6943,BU2Ogt_BCxQ.mp4,For me because it seems like I could potentially qualify and we live so close.
6944,BU2Ogt_BCxQ.mp4,I live within walking distance.
6945,BU2Ogt_BCxQ.mp4,So I figured it would be too hard to get here and I could just walk and just be helpful to humanity at this time.
6946,BU2Ogt_BCxQ.mp4,It's just unprecedented with this vaccine.
6947,BU2Ogt_BCxQ.mp4,We will be delivering a messenger RNA what we hope then is that when the messenger RNA goes in it tells the cells to make the gene protein which is actually the spike protein that big red glob on all those cartoons.
6948,BU2Ogt_BCxQ.mp4,You've seen of the virus on the surface.
6949,BU2Ogt_BCxQ.mp4,That's the main target for antibodies.
6950,BU2Ogt_BCxQ.mp4,So if the vaccine instructs the cells to make that protein then the body will make an immune response antibodies against that protein and those then would be in place.
6951,BU2Ogt_BCxQ.mp4,We hope and provide protection against a future encounter with the real virus down the road.
6952,BU2Ogt_BCxQ.mp4,"You know, we're very excited that Our partner in this vaccine research Pfizer has asked us to participate and I think they did so you know for a few reasons NYU Grossman school of medicine is a leader."
6953,BU2Ogt_BCxQ.mp4,We have the facilities.
6954,BU2Ogt_BCxQ.mp4,We have the scientists.
6955,BU2Ogt_BCxQ.mp4,We have all the technology to do this kind of research our office of science and research has built up an amazing system for clinical trials research and we have the experience.
6956,BU2Ogt_BCxQ.mp4,We have the investigators like myself and others and I think Pfizer recognized that they knew the track record the strength of NYU Grossman school of medicine.
6957,BU2Ogt_BCxQ.mp4,They knew that New York was at the heart of this pandemic that we were suffering greatly but that we also have a fighting spirit and that we want to contribute and participate.
6958,BU2Ogt_BCxQ.mp4,So I think those are the reasons that and I'm very happy that it's true that we were chosen to participate in this research.
6959,gBeVFBjMECk.mp4,"Hello, everyone."
6960,gBeVFBjMECk.mp4,I hope you're staying safe in these trying times.
6961,gBeVFBjMECk.mp4,I'm pretty overwhelmed with the anxiety and uncertainty and I can imagine many of you would be too.
6962,gBeVFBjMECk.mp4,I know a lot of parents are finding it hard to answer questions their children have about coronavirus.
6963,gBeVFBjMECk.mp4,They're not sure how to talk to them without scaring them.
6964,gBeVFBjMECk.mp4,So parents listen up.
6965,gBeVFBjMECk.mp4,I have some advice from UNICEF experts which will help Comfort your children.
6966,gBeVFBjMECk.mp4,Ask your children how much they already know and follow their lead if they're particularly young and haven't heard about the outbreak.
6967,gBeVFBjMECk.mp4,You may not need to raise the issue take the chance to remind them about good hygiene practices without introducing new fears.
6968,gBeVFBjMECk.mp4,Allow your child to talk freely open up a discussion don't minimize or avoid their concerns assure them that it's natural to feel scared about these things and give them your full attention.
6969,gBeVFBjMECk.mp4,If you can't answer their questions don't guess use it as an opportunity to explore the answers together explained that some information online is an accurate and that it's best to trust the experts go to unicef.org or check out the World Health Organization for updates pay attention to what your children see or hear on television radio or online misinformation can cause a lot of anxiety and fear.
6970,gBeVFBjMECk.mp4,One of the best ways to keep your children safe from coronavirus is to encourage regular hand washing and physical distancing.
6971,gBeVFBjMECk.mp4,It doesn't need to be awkward make it fun singing along for 20 seconds and show them how to wash their hands thoroughly or ask them to play a guessing game about how far six feet of distance between people really is you can also show children how to cover a cough or a sneeze with their elbow.
6972,gBeVFBjMECk.mp4,Tell them not to Get too close to people who have those symptoms and ask them to let you know if they're feeling unwell.
6973,gBeVFBjMECk.mp4,"Keep regular routines and schedules as much as possible, especially before your kids go to sleep reassure them that you know, it's hard maybe scary or even very boring and lonely at times that that following the rules will help keep everyone safe."
6974,gBeVFBjMECk.mp4,Avoid language that might blame others and lead to stigma and discrimination explained that viruses can make anyone sick regardless of a person's race or ethnicity or gender and that we shouldn't make assumptions about who might have coronavirus in times of Crisis such as this we must be kind supportive and empathetic.
6975,gBeVFBjMECk.mp4,Finally and most importantly make sure they know you're always available to listen and talk remember children will take emotional cues from you.
6976,gBeVFBjMECk.mp4,So do what you can to manage your anxiety and not over share your fears.
6977,gBeVFBjMECk.mp4,Try not letting your emotions get in the way of their sense of security.
6978,gBeVFBjMECk.mp4,If you found this video helpful do share it with your family and friends.
6979,UTzUtW3qs7M.mp4,The covid-19 pandemic has brought our world to a standstill raising.
6980,UTzUtW3qs7M.mp4,Scary questions.
6981,UTzUtW3qs7M.mp4,Like how is the virus spreading is it mutating?
6982,UTzUtW3qs7M.mp4,"If so, what does that mean mutations in itself is pretty mundane because viruses continuously do this bacteria do this, you know, all organisms and mutate but the vast majority of the time that these mutations really do nothing to impact to the virus."
6983,UTzUtW3qs7M.mp4,And nor should they be a concern to the public that's tooFor Nathan grubaugh.
6984,UTzUtW3qs7M.mp4,He's an assistant professor of epidemiology at the Yale School of Public Health and his lab studies something called genomic epidemiology.
6985,UTzUtW3qs7M.mp4,We sequence viruses to understand their genetic code and their genetic relatedness and based on that genetic relatedness.
6986,UTzUtW3qs7M.mp4,Like how you would construct a a family tree.
6987,UTzUtW3qs7M.mp4,We make these phylogenetic trees and that helps us to understand how outbreaks in different regions are actually connected.
6988,UTzUtW3qs7M.mp4,His methods have been applied.
6989,UTzUtW3qs7M.mp4,"Lied to other viral epidemics like zika and Ebola, so he's familiar with studying how viruses spread and mutate."
6990,UTzUtW3qs7M.mp4,We like to say that we Embrace mutations versus fear them because the collection of them end up becoming this very powerful tool for us that reveals a lot of hidden information.
6991,UTzUtW3qs7M.mp4,So that is what my lab is doing now is we're sequencing viruses from Connecticut and collaborating with people from around the world to construct these very large phylogenetic trees so that we can see the true patterns of spread.
6992,UTzUtW3qs7M.mp4,We can investigate if the viruses that are causing outbreaks in Connecticut and other regions These are being caused by domestic importations or if they're being caused by International implications.
6993,UTzUtW3qs7M.mp4,So we have a study right now that's on men archive in is in review that is done just that and we found that the outbreak in Connecticut is actually phylogenetically linked to the outbreak in Washington state.
6994,UTzUtW3qs7M.mp4,So the virus has already been spread coast to coast in our country and by looking at Travel patterns and epidemiological patterns.
6995,UTzUtW3qs7M.mp4,We also see that there's a higher likelihood now a virus is being Reduced into our region from other US states than internationally.
6996,UTzUtW3qs7M.mp4,So that should impact How We Do policy.
6997,UTzUtW3qs7M.mp4,Dr.
6998,UTzUtW3qs7M.mp4,Groove has findings have been aided by open source data with his colleagues from across the field especially in genomics were really good at sharing data and creating these websites that were reading aggregate a lot of data together to learn more as a community than we can is just one individual working in the Asylum and also because we need to do things quick we have these portable Technologies called them.
6999,UTzUtW3qs7M.mp4,And I am that we can actually generate data really rapidly things like this.
7000,UTzUtW3qs7M.mp4,Just give us so much power to control the amount of data in the speed of data that we can generate and how we disseminate that while the case is continued to grow.
7001,UTzUtW3qs7M.mp4,So does the amount of data at the disposal of the medical community?
7002,UTzUtW3qs7M.mp4,"I don't study coronavirus has or respiratory diseases, but our group does have a really good handle on virus Evolution and genomics and all the technology that It goes in with it here at Yale were working with Hospital in such a wide net of collaborators so that we can do more to help our local community."
7003,UTzUtW3qs7M.mp4,And I think that gives us a leg up on being able to respond to this as it grows and intensifies because we're learning so much about what is happening right now as a collective team.
7004,7n-JfsVA8UU.mp4,"Hi, my name is Dee."
7005,7n-JfsVA8UU.mp4,And I'm a child life Specialists here at Monroe Carell Jr. Children's Hospital at Vanderbilt.
7006,7n-JfsVA8UU.mp4,My job is to help patients and families understand what happens at the hospital and doctors office because keeping our patients healthy is the most important thing to us.
7007,7n-JfsVA8UU.mp4,You've probably heard about the coronavirus or covid-19 germ.
7008,7n-JfsVA8UU.mp4,That's making a lot of people sick.
7009,7n-JfsVA8UU.mp4,There are a few ways to check for this germ.
7010,7n-JfsVA8UU.mp4,"And if you need to be checked, we want you to know what to expect."
7011,7n-JfsVA8UU.mp4,The person checking for The Germ will be dressed like this wearing a mask a face shield and a gallon to protect against germs.
7012,7n-JfsVA8UU.mp4,They'll need to check the inside of your nose or your throat with a long and bendy swab like one of these Someone like your mom or dad can be with you or even hold you keeping very very still is the best thing you can do to help the swab will be in your nose or throat for about 10 seconds.
7013,7n-JfsVA8UU.mp4,"If it goes into your nose, it helps to blow your nose right before the swab might feel uncomfortable make you want to sneeze cough or make your eyes water take a deep breath when the swab goes in count to ten in your mind or out loud and Your job is to hold very very still some children who've had their nose checked tell us that when it's over their nose felt warm or tickly kind of like when you get water up your nose getting check for covid-19."
7014,7n-JfsVA8UU.mp4,Does it mean you have the germ knowing whether or not you have it just helps us to take care of you in the best possible way and that's why we check remember any time you're planning to visit the hospital or doctor's office.
7015,7n-JfsVA8UU.mp4,It helps to bring something from home that's comforting like a stuffed animal.
7016,7n-JfsVA8UU.mp4,Melor your favorite blanket.
7017,7n-JfsVA8UU.mp4,Thank you for doing your part to help us take care of you.

7023,k-A8Ox3ucd0.mp4,It's the equivalent of a new diagnosis every second.

7043,k-A8Ox3ucd0.mp4,Thank you Adriana very much.
7044,RSRINT0ygiE.mp4,"Hi guys, Chris again."
7045,RSRINT0ygiE.mp4,I'm here today with dr. Casey wolfington know everybody in the community.
7046,RSRINT0ygiE.mp4,I think knows Casey.
7047,RSRINT0ygiE.mp4,Luckily we get to work with Casey every day.
7048,RSRINT0ygiE.mp4,And one thing that we've been talking with Casey is how do we deal with the anxiety and the fear that we all have and so here's here's a situation that I'd love to for Casey to share some of our thoughts but the situation is covid is here to stay.
7049,RSRINT0ygiE.mp4,Unfortunately.
7050,RSRINT0ygiE.mp4,It's endemic no amount of time that we wait is covid-19.Disappear in this community and until there's a vaccine which could be a year 18 months to even two years.
7051,RSRINT0ygiE.mp4,We're going to have to learn how to deal with it and live with it and get back to some order of normalcy.
7052,RSRINT0ygiE.mp4,"So for the past two months now, we've been scaring people stay at home."
7053,RSRINT0ygiE.mp4,We know it's a dangerous disease.
7054,RSRINT0ygiE.mp4,We want them to be protected.
7055,RSRINT0ygiE.mp4,But how do we now transition back into some normalcy?
7056,RSRINT0ygiE.mp4,Right?
7057,RSRINT0ygiE.mp4,Well a couple things like you mentioned I think scaring and fear was really productive.
7058,RSRINT0ygiE.mp4,"Yeah, it allowed us to Emmitt our interactions flatten our curve and really be very productive in responding to covid-19."
7059,RSRINT0ygiE.mp4,The problem with that is now we're starting to see other things escalate.
7060,RSRINT0ygiE.mp4,We're seeing lack of connection.
7061,RSRINT0ygiE.mp4,We're seeing increased in behavioral health concerns people that have unsafe environments at home are starting to really have some serious concerns home isn't always safe for people.
7062,RSRINT0ygiE.mp4,That's a really good point and connection is really important.
7063,RSRINT0ygiE.mp4,I think the other thing is that as humans were not Be great at assessing risk our emotions get incredibly involved and covid-19 S been very emotional every single time.
7064,RSRINT0ygiE.mp4,We turn on the news.
7065,RSRINT0ygiE.mp4,There's a human interest or story that tugs at our heartstrings locally.
7066,RSRINT0ygiE.mp4,"All of us have had and probably some sort of impact from somebody being infected hospitalized possibly passing away as a result of that and that creates a lot of emotion around it, which makes us feel that the risk is so much bigger than it is."
7067,RSRINT0ygiE.mp4,And I think the other component of that is we're now starting to know that covid-19 has been in our community for a long at least three months.
7068,RSRINT0ygiE.mp4,Okay.
7069,RSRINT0ygiE.mp4,So at least three months and we have been under social distancing orders for seven weeks seven weeks.
7070,RSRINT0ygiE.mp4,"And so the fact is that our risk to covid was here for at least five to six weeks prior to all of this lockdown, but when we're re-engaging into society, we really feel like the risk is so much greater now and and How do ways we're actually way more protected now, we know how transmission occurs we know ways to protect ourselves."
7071,RSRINT0ygiE.mp4,"We know the importance of hygiene and face masks and different pieces and so in a lot of ways, we don't see how we're actually should be a little more calm than we were in January."
7072,RSRINT0ygiE.mp4,So one other thing we have is we have a great testing mechanism.
7073,RSRINT0ygiE.mp4,Yeah up until March 4th.
7074,RSRINT0ygiE.mp4,We had no way to test for Coronavirus in this community.
7075,RSRINT0ygiE.mp4,"We now have testing across the entire Valley and again, If people are sick, or they think they have covid they all I need to do is go get tested and within 48 hours."
7076,RSRINT0ygiE.mp4,"We know if they have it and we know what they need to do, which is in stay home isolate and talk to their doctor if they get worse."
7077,RSRINT0ygiE.mp4,"I think that as a mental health piece is key that hey if you're worried you have it we can now tell you yeah, exactly."
7078,RSRINT0ygiE.mp4,Absolutely and if we do if we again go back to February January when people were starting to have symptoms that they would probably have that wait and see yeah they're going Work there in small rooms with their colleagues.
7079,RSRINT0ygiE.mp4,"They're not doing any precautions, but the fact is that we have the knowledge to protect ourselves."
7080,RSRINT0ygiE.mp4,So we're in a much better spot.
7081,RSRINT0ygiE.mp4,Right and we've tamper down the virus significantly in this community or the past seven weeks by everybody just doing a really great job of not only social distancing but the things you talked about wearing a mask when in public washing your hands and so keep it all that in mind.
7082,RSRINT0ygiE.mp4,"Maybe we should look forward a little bit more optimism going forward and maybe And a way to handle some of these fears absolutely and being able to connect as a community again social connection is so incredibly important is actually the most strong predictor of Health outcomes, right?"
7083,RSRINT0ygiE.mp4,So so with that we want everybody to continue stay connected in a safe appropriate way.
7084,RSRINT0ygiE.mp4,"Yeah, and we're optimistic about the future here in this Valley and grateful for what everybody's doing."
7085,RSRINT0ygiE.mp4,Yeah.
7086,RSRINT0ygiE.mp4,Thank you Casey.
7087,RSRINT0ygiE.mp4,Thank you.
7088,RSRINT0ygiE.mp4,Thanks.
7089,bVA8EPrTc1c.mp4,Small or big it has nothing to do with stars.
7090,bVA8EPrTc1c.mp4,Dependently through which part of the respiratory tract are passes and where the virus is and what we do whether we Embrace we speak or we sing there are different size of a results generated different concentrations of them.
7091,bVA8EPrTc1c.mp4,"And then if they pass through the area of the respiratory tract where there's violence, they also become virus on the web So This Cloud is cloud, which stays around in the air."
7092,bVA8EPrTc1c.mp4,"It may contain the virus and if that's the case, they stay suspended in the air and they can stay suspended in the air for quite a long time until they are somehow removed from the air and in places were ventilation is inefficient insufficient."
7093,bVA8EPrTc1c.mp4,They can stay for a long very long time.
7094,bVA8EPrTc1c.mp4,They could easily stay in there for a few hours.
7095,bVA8EPrTc1c.mp4,The depends on the condition of the environment viruses this of the Skype like cool air and dry conditions.
7096,bVA8EPrTc1c.mp4,"So if these are the conditions like in many Office Buildings, for example, this could be good conditions."
7097,bVA8EPrTc1c.mp4,If on the other hand we go outside where there is hot.
7098,bVA8EPrTc1c.mp4,And in addition you will radiation well with very short period of time they will be deactivated.
7099,bVA8EPrTc1c.mp4,What very much so but this is not the only aspect Sun's UV radiation.
7100,bVA8EPrTc1c.mp4,"It is the very first dilution Outdoors, which is a well a large Reservoir dilution is very fast."
7101,bVA8EPrTc1c.mp4,So therefore the Airborne transmission Outdoors has very little chance has to work it out.
7102,bVA8EPrTc1c.mp4,"Of course, there is still that conduct if you are standing next to somebody for long time and this person sneezes it you are something like That's the clothes comp."
7103,bVA8EPrTc1c.mp4,"But otherwise in Airborne transmission, it's much less likely people."
7104,naV4Vmc5gIc.mp4,We have discussed and collaborated with many of the signatories of the articles that you have mentioned over the last few months and indeed we discussed the available evidence that has been discussed in these pieces.
7105,naV4Vmc5gIc.mp4,And also we received contributions from many of the signatories of these pieces.
7106,naV4Vmc5gIc.mp4,We are acknowledge that there is emerging evidence in this field as in all other fields regarding the covid-19 virus and pandemic and therefore we believe that we have to be open to this evidence and understand its implications regarding the modes of transmission and also regarding the precautions that Need to be taken.
7107,naV4Vmc5gIc.mp4,"Would you like to add something Maria just say thank you benedetta just to say that yes, you know, we have been engaged with this group since April when they first wrote To Us on April 1st, and we've had an active engagement with them and with many of the signatories on this through different networks."
7108,naV4Vmc5gIc.mp4,"And as we have said previously we welcome the interaction from scientists all over the world from many different disciplines many of the signatories are Engineers, which is a wonderful area."
7109,naV4Vmc5gIc.mp4,Of expertise which adds to Growing knowledge about the importance of ventilation which we feel also is very important.
7110,naV4Vmc5gIc.mp4,We have been talking about the possibility of Airborne transmission an aerosol transmission as one of the modes of transmission of covid-19 as well as droplet.
7111,naV4Vmc5gIc.mp4,We've looked at fomites.
7112,naV4Vmc5gIc.mp4,We look at fecal-oral.
7113,naV4Vmc5gIc.mp4,We look at mother-to-child.
7114,naV4Vmc5gIc.mp4,We look at animal to human of course as well.
7115,naV4Vmc5gIc.mp4,And so we are producing scientific brief on summarizing where we are.
7116,naV4Vmc5gIc.mp4,We've been working on.
7117,naV4Vmc5gIc.mp4,"This for several weeks now and we've engaged with a large number of groups epidemiologist and clinicians IPC Specialists Engineers mathematical modelers to try to consolidate the growing knowledge around around transmission, but we have spoken about the the importance of all of the different potential modes of transmission."
7118,naV4Vmc5gIc.mp4,This is a respiratory pathogen and so it is important that what we know fits into the guidance that we have which is why a comprehensive package of Interventions are required to be able to stop transmission.
7119,naV4Vmc5gIc.mp4,This includes not only physical distancing and includes the use of masks where appropriate in certain settings specifically where you can't do physical distancing and especially for healthcare workers.
7120,naV4Vmc5gIc.mp4,"So our focus on the use of mass, of course is for healthcare workers and to use airborne precautions where you have those aerosol generating procedures, but we're also looking at the possible role of Airborne Transmission in other settings where you have particularly closed set."
7121,naV4Vmc5gIc.mp4,"Games where you have poor ventilation, so we will be issuing our brief in the coming days and that will outline everything that we have in this area."
7122,9D30-gzEhWk.mp4,The power of a pineapple is tonight being harnessed to battle coronavirus researchers trialing a treatment using extracts from the sweet fruit that could spell a treatment and stop the virus spreading in our community.
7123,9D30-gzEhWk.mp4,This golden fruit could be our golden ticket to fight covid-19.
7124,9D30-gzEhWk.mp4,"We think this could be a very major step forward for both the virus and hopefully for this country donning a pineapple cap, this is Professor David Morris, he and a team of researchers at the University of New South with whales are adapting brahmic a cancer drug to create a nasal spray using an enzyme from The Humble pineapple to dissolve coronavirus proteins."
7125,9D30-gzEhWk.mp4,We think the treating this disease in the nose and throat with this simple medication using a nose spray should prevent it from spreading to other parts of the body.
7126,9D30-gzEhWk.mp4,It should render the virus non infective to people around that patient scientists.
7127,9D30-gzEhWk.mp4,Say the spray could provide relief from the worst of the virus.
7128,9D30-gzEhWk.mp4,Impacts that it will limit the number of infections and the seriousness of the disease in people are Frontline workers also hoped to benefit able to use the spray to protect themselves from the infection when exposed to covid-19 patients.
7129,9D30-gzEhWk.mp4,"The drug is tonight being produced in Australia and in large quantities, it would be possible to supply the world from Australia with this medication patients will soon begin testing the spray."
7130,9D30-gzEhWk.mp4,We've had fantastic results so far with our live virus This test we have to try to make things better Sully guyot 9 News.
7131,I0TmBsHaGmI.mp4,The World Health Organization was informed of an outbreak of pneumonia of unknown cause detected in Wuhan China on the 31st of December 2019 today.
7132,I0TmBsHaGmI.mp4,"We know that the Infectious agent was a virus of the coronavirus family, which was named SARS COV to that causes a respiratory disease termed covid-19."
7133,I0TmBsHaGmI.mp4,"This virus has not only received widespread media coverage, but also caught the attention of scientists who have been busy analyzing.In the virus the disease it causes and how it spreads there is already an enormous amount of information available about the virus."
7134,I0TmBsHaGmI.mp4,And that is why we thought to summarize some of the information in this video.
7135,I0TmBsHaGmI.mp4,"First of all, what do we know about the virus coronavirus has received a name from their appearance in electron micrographs where the pronounced Spike like protrusions create the effect of a Corona letting for Crown The genetic material inside the coronavirus is RNA and the entire genome is almost 30,000 bases long pack together with the nucleoprotein into the viral particle of the Orion."
7136,I0TmBsHaGmI.mp4,"For the virus to replicate however, it needs to insert its RNA into cells and hijack the cellular Machinery to produce new viruses."
7137,I0TmBsHaGmI.mp4,On its surface the virion contained three main proteins the envelope the hemagglutinin esterase and the spike protein.
7138,I0TmBsHaGmI.mp4,"These are embedded into a lipid bilayer the large Spike protein is responsible for the crown like protrusions, but it also recognizes the corresponding receptors on human cells called a stupa protease aids to mediate the cleavage of the spike protein which then releases an epitope and enabling the subsequent Fusion of the virus with the human cell."

7153,HJsKFGUE-Ak.mp4,on the bottom of the lift I'm sure it's closed.
7154,HJsKFGUE-Ak.mp4,"Yeah, go ahead."
7155,HJsKFGUE-Ak.mp4,Try.
7156,HJsKFGUE-Ak.mp4,It doesn't matter which side.
7157,HJsKFGUE-Ak.mp4,would empty the movie box to the left over the top and like to thank you very much.

7159,HJsKFGUE-Ak.mp4,You too.
7160,Vo9IJ5Ijr-8.mp4,"A few days ago when I shared some data showing that Spain was on the same trajectory as Italy that is even though Italy had ten times as many cases growth and the daily number of cases was almost identical it took Italy six days to go from about a hundred and fifty to one thousand cases and it took Spain the exact same amount of time now March 13th, we have updated data Spain has just surpassed 4,000 confirmed."
7161,Vo9IJ5Ijr-8.mp4,"Cases, why was this so predictable?"
7162,Vo9IJ5Ijr-8.mp4,It's because if you have similar societies with similar Disease Control measures identical human biology and an identical virus the results can basically be predicted when Spain reached 150 cases that appeared to be about the critical mass after which contagion across countries is very similar.
7163,Vo9IJ5Ijr-8.mp4,So to go from one case to 10 cases from Tim cases to a hundred cases.
7164,Vo9IJ5Ijr-8.mp4,This is very hard to predict.
7165,Vo9IJ5Ijr-8.mp4,"Because each individual behaves very differently randomly, right?"
7166,Vo9IJ5Ijr-8.mp4,But once you're at a critical mass that Randomness kind of cancels out and so the time it takes to go from 150 to a thousand or from a thousand to ten thousand given a similar set of circumstances is going to be pretty similar across different places and different times the Italy and Spain similarities are not a one-off case.
7167,Vo9IJ5Ijr-8.mp4,"In fact, the Italian trajectory is the same trajectory being followed by the disease outbreaks."
7168,Vo9IJ5Ijr-8.mp4,"In most of the Western European countries and in the United States, the only difference is that Italy is a few days ahead of these these other countries the u.s. Germany France UK Denmark."
7169,Vo9IJ5Ijr-8.mp4,We all seem to be on the Italian trajectory.
7170,Vo9IJ5Ijr-8.mp4,"Now, let's let's compare this with the outbreak in China excluding The hoobae Province these great lines on the chart to show Chinese provinces Chinese Disease Control measures social distancing active case detection."
7171,Vo9IJ5Ijr-8.mp4,Cases to a minimum.
7172,Vo9IJ5Ijr-8.mp4,So there's some Hope from China's trajectory There's Hope from other countries to let's take a look at Singapore and Japan.
7173,Vo9IJ5Ijr-8.mp4,They went past the 150 critical mass but managed to keep growth thereafter to to a minimum and then there's South Korea even though South Korea got to some pretty high numbers since then they've taken effective measures to control the outbreak.
7174,Vo9IJ5Ijr-8.mp4,There are a lot of variables that we don't know like the number of people that are infected but don't get tested.
7175,Vo9IJ5Ijr-8.mp4,What we do know is that reactive measures are very ineffective at controlling covid-19.
7176,Vo9IJ5Ijr-8.mp4,What we've seen in the case of china is that outside of hoobae provinces were able to keep caseload relatively Low by taking very proactive very drastic measures what we've seen so far in the outbreak in the Euro and Europe and in the u.s. Is that these reactive measures kind of piecewise slowly reacting to new cases with incremental shutdowns?
7177,Vo9IJ5Ijr-8.mp4,It's quarantines doesn't seem to have been sufficient to slow the tide of the outbreak.
7178,Vo9IJ5Ijr-8.mp4,What we do know about this disease is that it can spread very rapidly across a population and it has very high mortality rates among those who are particularly vulnerable.
7179,Vo9IJ5Ijr-8.mp4,We also know that it has the capacity to saturate and oversaturate Health Services.
7180,Vo9IJ5Ijr-8.mp4,So even if it doesn't necessarily kill you directly it can kill you or it can kill people.
7181,Vo9IJ5Ijr-8.mp4,By virtue of having basically taken Health Services past their capacity.
7182,Vo9IJ5Ijr-8.mp4,So my message having examined these data is that the scenario is changing extremely rapidly.
7183,Vo9IJ5Ijr-8.mp4,We need to take this very very seriously.
7184,Vo9IJ5Ijr-8.mp4,We have not taken it seriously enough so far.
7185,kPSzrPjXB-0.mp4,Coronavirus has are a large group of viruses that can cause illnesses ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome mers-cov and severe acute respiratory syndrome SARS COV.Coronavirus has can be transmitted between animals and people several known coronavirus has are circulating in animals that have not yet infected humans as a family coronavirus has are common across the globe recently a new strain of coronavirus was discovered that has not previously been identified in humans this new coronavirus.
7186,kPSzrPjXB-0.mp4,Sometimes referred to as the novel coronavirus.
7187,kPSzrPjXB-0.mp4,It's to Coronavirus disease also known as covid-19 common signs of infection include respiratory symptoms such as breathing difficulties and shortness of breath a cough or a fever.
7188,kPSzrPjXB-0.mp4,Infection can also lead to the much more severe consequences of pneumonia severe acute respiratory syndrome kidney failure and even death certain types of people are more at risk of developing severe symptoms than others the risk increases.

7196,zME-84Vwjuo.mp4,protect your community the symptoms of covid-19 can take from 2 to 14 days to appear.
7197,zME-84Vwjuo.mp4,They usually consist of fever dry cough.
7198,zME-84Vwjuo.mp4,or tiredness some people including children may experience mild symptoms.
7199,zME-84Vwjuo.mp4,Covid-19 spreads when a sick person coughs or sneezes small infectious droplets the droplets don't travel far but can land on surfaces that you made touch.
7200,zME-84Vwjuo.mp4,If you then touch your eyes nose or mouth.
7201,zME-84Vwjuo.mp4,You can become infected to protect yourself and others from covid-19.
7202,zME-84Vwjuo.mp4,You should avoid close contact with people outside your house won't keep one to two meters away from others as much.
7203,zME-84Vwjuo.mp4,As you can that's at least two arm lengths.
7204,zME-84Vwjuo.mp4,Wash your hands often with soap and water for more than 20 seconds or use alcohol-based hand sanitizers.

7207,qDkI7lfhjgw.mp4,He had trying to get the air in and out as a parent.
7208,qDkI7lfhjgw.mp4,I was just focused on trying to stay calm and he was having a coughing spasm.
7209,qDkI7lfhjgw.mp4,"Hey, buddy, you're doing great."
7210,qDkI7lfhjgw.mp4,Who's our really good choice as a doctor the medical term.
7211,qDkI7lfhjgw.mp4,Abs are retractions where you can see the muscles between the ribs moving.
7212,qDkI7lfhjgw.mp4,You can see the belly kind of wreathing and indentations underneath the ribs.
7213,qDkI7lfhjgw.mp4,So as a doctor I could see those medical things happening and as a Mom it just it's just gut-wrenching right?
7214,qDkI7lfhjgw.mp4,I know he's working hard to breathe.
7215,qDkI7lfhjgw.mp4,I know we're doing everything we can do.
7216,qDkI7lfhjgw.mp4,I know he's in a good place getting Port but he just keeps getting worse.
7217,qDkI7lfhjgw.mp4,Because he was so sick.
7218,qDkI7lfhjgw.mp4,We knew he was going to be kind of a rule out covid patient where they're concerned about it and they send all the testing.
7219,qDkI7lfhjgw.mp4,"So it was him and I in a room and it was him and I in a room and once I went in the room, I wasn't allowed to leave why was allowed to leave but then I couldn't come back and Wasn't an option for me."
7220,qDkI7lfhjgw.mp4,He's for he's scared.
7221,qDkI7lfhjgw.mp4,He's sick.
7222,qDkI7lfhjgw.mp4,And so it was him and I in a room.
7223,qDkI7lfhjgw.mp4,I don't really know how I don't really know how to explain what that feeling is.
7224,qDkI7lfhjgw.mp4,Like when you and your child who is getting worse every single hour are in a room just the two of you.
7225,qDkI7lfhjgw.mp4,Nurses were phenomenal.
7226,qDkI7lfhjgw.mp4,They brought us anything we needed.
7227,qDkI7lfhjgw.mp4,They would bring me water.
7228,qDkI7lfhjgw.mp4,They brought me food.
7229,qDkI7lfhjgw.mp4,They took great care of my son.
7230,qDkI7lfhjgw.mp4,"They would put all their protective gear on and come into the room, but they would only come in when they needed to because there's a national shortage of protective equipment."
7231,qDkI7lfhjgw.mp4,You're trying to preserve protective equipment.
7232,qDkI7lfhjgw.mp4,They are trying to keep themselves safe and limit their exposure.
7233,qDkI7lfhjgw.mp4,We had done everything we had stayed at home.
7234,qDkI7lfhjgw.mp4,We hadn't gone to activities.
7235,qDkI7lfhjgw.mp4,We'd been on spring break my husband and I hadn't been working.
7236,qDkI7lfhjgw.mp4,We just hung out at home that whole time so it wasn't on our radar because we had done everything that we were supposed to do.
7237,qDkI7lfhjgw.mp4,You don't realize how much you're holding your breath and how little you're sleeping and how tense you are as your child's getting worse and worse and worse.
7238,qDkI7lfhjgw.mp4,And then as soon as we were able to start to turn that flow down and he actually ate a popsicle.
7239,qDkI7lfhjgw.mp4,It's just like this weight comes off of you and you can breathe again.
7240,qDkI7lfhjgw.mp4,Yes covid is scary.
7241,qDkI7lfhjgw.mp4,"And yes, some kids can get really sick."
7242,qDkI7lfhjgw.mp4,But overall kids are still doing well.
7243,qDkI7lfhjgw.mp4,"Take it seriously, but only live through it once if It's going to happen."

7246,KYWEZiSAXQA.mp4,This IMF forecasts carries a sobering message the economic pain of covid-19 will be deep and protracted and nowhere will be spared for the first time.
7247,KYWEZiSAXQA.mp4,Every region of the world will face recession simple taneous.
7248,KYWEZiSAXQA.mp4,Lie this chart shows forecast growth with the Baseline in 2019.
7249,KYWEZiSAXQA.mp4,"Moving through to 2021 Global growth is projected to Fall by four point nine percent this year the largest contraction since the Great Depression a consequence of what the IMF calls the great lockdown.Developing economies face a lower contraction of 3% but the consequences of the recession for the poorest countries are severe advanced economies, including Europe and the US are forecast to contract by 8% China where the virus began and which lock down early and was back in business by April will actually grow by when one percent now you can see these economies will recover over the course of 20 21."
7250,KYWEZiSAXQA.mp4,"The forecast is for Global growth of 5% and that would deliver not a rapid these shape recovery, but a slower swoosh shape."
7251,KYWEZiSAXQA.mp4,So how do we compare?
7252,KYWEZiSAXQA.mp4,"The European countries worst affected by coronavirus will suffer the deepest recessions Italy and Spain will contract by 12.8% in France by 12 and a half percent the UK faces a 10.2 percent decline the worst fall in GDP in 300 years and worse than the u.s. At 8% and Germany, which will shrink by 7.8% now all these countries are forecast to recover next year by Four and seven percent but that will still leave the UK with a smaller economy."
7253,KYWEZiSAXQA.mp4,Even by the end of 2020 one the level of GDP in the UK will be lower than the pre-crisis levels.
7254,KYWEZiSAXQA.mp4,This is a prolonged State and as we know there are sectors that are getting hit in this crisis are the ones that employ low skilled workers.
7255,KYWEZiSAXQA.mp4,They also tend to be more labor intensive.
7256,KYWEZiSAXQA.mp4,And so the effect on employment can be substantial the IMF warns that the looming recession will hit the poorest in every nation hardest to soften the blow.
7257,KYWEZiSAXQA.mp4,It's calling for international collaborations.

7280,fEtieV_9vJM.mp4,"Yeah, they say there's a lot to learn here."
7281,fEtieV_9vJM.mp4,But they say what they're what you learn to do is read the signals differently.
7282,fEtieV_9vJM.mp4,"And in fact, they say it can be a big help for a lot of people one because they don't have to leave the office or home and two because they might feel much more comfortable in their familiar surroundings that in a therapist office and the research backs that up it works Shepard Smith here."
7283,fEtieV_9vJM.mp4,Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube.
7284,HWn-pGf4B-M.mp4,"video starts by kind of going through the bones the bones melting away and then kind of taking you around the chest on the outside anything in yellow that you're seeing is covid infected destroyed lung tissue, which struck me, you know, almost right away and you know for somebody especially for someone who's been in practice from US 20 years is just kind of the the extent of the lung damage so So, you know in the past this has been compared to you know, your garden-variety pneumonia."
7285,HWn-pGf4B-M.mp4,It's been compared to the seasonal flu.
7286,HWn-pGf4B-M.mp4,And one of the things we need to get across and we try harder and harder every day is that this is nothing like the seasonal flu.
7287,HWn-pGf4B-M.mp4,This is not like your typical pneumonia a typical.
7288,HWn-pGf4B-M.mp4,"Let's say bacterial pneumonia would typically affect, you know one part of the lung perhaps, you know, when lobe of the lung and again as you can see The video it not only affects both lungs but effects of various parts of each long."
7289,HWn-pGf4B-M.mp4,So it's pretty diffuse damage.
7290,HWn-pGf4B-M.mp4,And the other thing the caveat in all this too is that the cat that the images that you are looking at the video that you're looking at is based on the CAT scan that was performed before he got so sick that had to be intubated and placed on a ventilator.
7291,HWn-pGf4B-M.mp4,So if you were to repeat that cats can perhaps 48 hours later chances are you're going to be seeing much more?
7292,HWn-pGf4B-M.mp4,Or yellow than you actually are that things would be even worse about halfway through the video.
7293,HWn-pGf4B-M.mp4,We do what's called a virtual bronchoscopy.
7294,HWn-pGf4B-M.mp4,"Where now you get come get the bird's eye view and you start going into the trachea into the major Airway and then you go down into the right lung and now that you're actually inside the right lung and kind of seeing some of those yellow areas, you know up close and personal."
7295,HWn-pGf4B-M.mp4,"This was a 59 year old gentleman with who did not have you know, you hear a lot about you know, this This only affects elderly patients or somebody's got lots of other medical problems or immunosuppressed and the more and more we learn about, you know, our experience here in the US the more we know that that's not true."
7296,HWn-pGf4B-M.mp4,"We know that you know, the elderly immunosuppressed patients without a medical problems are more severely affected but the disease is not limited to them."
7297,BKxnX3-yvng.mp4,Wow them as Adam just mentioned.
7298,BKxnX3-yvng.mp4,Here's a Pfizer as well as its German partner by on Tech or trading higher today.
7299,BKxnX3-yvng.mp4,"That's after Pfizer said it's vaccine won't be ready in time for the election, but it might not be too long afterwards that it applies for approval Anjali."
7300,BKxnX3-yvng.mp4,Come Lonnie is here with the latest on where it is in the process Anjali.
7301,BKxnX3-yvng.mp4,"Thanks, Julie."
7302,BKxnX3-yvng.mp4,"So what we're looking at is Pfizer basically agreeing to what is more broadly being accepted by the scientific.The community and by the farm industry when it comes to the guidelines for the coronavirus vaccine, we know that the FDA has been pushing and has pushed for a two-month observation period up from one it which is what it was before and that all those details are up for a discussion on October 22nd and advisory council meeting."
7303,BKxnX3-yvng.mp4,So we're waiting to hear more about that but it seems like more broadly this has been accepted Pfizer initially saying continue to commit to that timeline of having initial data ready.
7304,BKxnX3-yvng.mp4,"He by the end of this month, but for the first time saying and agreeing out loud to wait to apply for the EU a that emergency use authorization by the third week of November, which is when it would complete, you know, that op that observational window."
7305,BKxnX3-yvng.mp4,So definitely waiting to see more on that.
7306,BKxnX3-yvng.mp4,"Meanwhile, we know moderna has already said repeatedly that my Thanksgiving is when they would have their initial data."
7307,BKxnX3-yvng.mp4,"So it really puts it a little bit behind the game there and when we're talking about No, just the the coronavirus pandemic right now continues to be a problem as we're entering the second wave and while you know, all hopes are on the vaccine and the fact that we might get at least one approval or authorization Sorry by the end of the year."
7308,BKxnX3-yvng.mp4,It still doesn't help what will happen in the coming months when it comes to hospitalizations and testing and so we're waiting to hear more about that.
7309,BKxnX3-yvng.mp4,"But what's happening right now is CMS the centers for Medicare and Medicaid services, which sets the reimbursement payments for a lot of services for Medicare recently came out with new guidance on lab testing."
7310,BKxnX3-yvng.mp4,We know that when you know hotspots were battling shortages of tests.
7311,BKxnX3-yvng.mp4,We saw that there was a lot of delays and turnaround time and you know Health experts criticizing saying that the test results are not useful if they're more than a week or delayed in any way.
7312,BKxnX3-yvng.mp4,So CMS really clamping down saying that they're going to cut payments to these clinical Labs that process them possibly.
7313,BKxnX3-yvng.mp4,You 275 sorry 275 dollars down from a hundred if they delay more than two days of something that's of concern.
7314,BKxnX3-yvng.mp4,"Now as we're getting into this second wave and and anticipating really another round of possible shortages, even though testing capacity has in fact increased but if the volume gets overwhelming and something that is of concern right now, actually that's really interesting."
7315,BKxnX3-yvng.mp4,We'll see if that kind of penalization actually works to speed up the testing quick question on emergency use authorization.
7316,BKxnX3-yvng.mp4,Options even after Pfizer applies then how long does the government typically take to consider one of those requests as quickly as a few weeks to as much as a few months that is what FDA officials have previously said on record the EU a is takes a little less data and information to process and analyze.
7317,BKxnX3-yvng.mp4,So that's where the quicker timeline sort of comes into play.
7318,BKxnX3-yvng.mp4,"But when we're talking about, you know looking at the full approval that is What will take more months and more data is necessary for that Angelique Imani."
7319,BKxnX3-yvng.mp4,Thank you.
7320,BKxnX3-yvng.mp4,So.
7321,QfL2sespLnY.mp4,And that's the primary endpoint of most of the virus is to prevent clinical disease to prevent symptomatic disease not necessarily to prevent infection.
7322,QfL2sespLnY.mp4,That's a secondary endpoint.
7323,QfL2sespLnY.mp4,"But the primary thing you want to do is that if people get infected prevent them from getting sick and if you prevent them from getting sick, you will ultimately prevent them from getting seriously ill so that's what we want to do the first point, which we call a primary."
7324,QfL2sespLnY.mp4,"Point is that if the vaccine also allows you to prevent initial infection, that would be great."
7325,QfL2sespLnY.mp4,But what I would settle for and all of my colleagues would settle for is the primary endpoint to prevent clinically recognizable disease and that's what we hope happens.
7326,QfL2sespLnY.mp4,"And if we do that we'll go a long way to defusing this very difficult crisis that were in Of course, I'm going to the point that you've made that the vaccine won't be the end of the story definitely mitigation tactics will remain in place for some time going on to the the trials themselves."
7327,QfL2sespLnY.mp4,It seems like the UK is setting up to do a challenge trial and while we're already have some vaccines in late-stage Trials here.
7328,QfL2sespLnY.mp4,It does seem that with the number of candidates out there.
7329,QfL2sespLnY.mp4,There's some room for using this strategy is the u.s.
7330,QfL2sespLnY.mp4,Setting up to do a challenge trial as well.
7331,QfL2sespLnY.mp4,"You know, we really don't think that that's Every when you have so many infections, I mean we are having in this country as we started the discussion off with over 80,000 infections per day fundamentally."
7332,QfL2sespLnY.mp4,"When you do challenge studies are a number of reasons, one of the most important of which is that there's not enough disease activity out there for your vaccine trial to give you a definitive answer and even though challenge studies may have a place Under certain circumstances."
7333,QfL2sespLnY.mp4,It's not the same as the actual circumstances with which a person gets naturally infected.
7334,QfL2sespLnY.mp4,So although you can get some good information from a challenge trial the real world information that you want is out in the field when someone is actually being exposed to Natural infection and to determine if the vaccine prevents against that so right now we're not In any challenge studies because we have so much infection going on.
7335,QfL2sespLnY.mp4,"We have five or six vaccines that will be in trial in the midst of these 80,000 per day infection."
7336,QfL2sespLnY.mp4,I think we're going to get enough information that we need to make a decision as to the safety in the efficacy of a vaccine without resorting to a challenge trial.
7337,uaclvunMMcM.mp4,Covid-19 continues to spread around the globe.
7338,uaclvunMMcM.mp4,You can help stop covid-19 by participating in contact tracing.
7339,uaclvunMMcM.mp4,"How does contact tracing work contact tracing is a system that has been used for decades to stop infectious diseases a contact is anyone who has had Direct physical contact always within one meter for at least 15 minutes with an infected person, even if that person does not have symptoms this applies to anyone who has had contact from two days before a person gets sick until 14."
7340,uaclvunMMcM.mp4,Days afterwards or from the 14 days when an asymptomatic case tested positive.
7341,uaclvunMMcM.mp4,"Once you are confirmed as a contact, you will be asked to go into quarantine which means to separate yourself from others and to monitor your health for any signs of illness the monitoring ends on the 14th Day from your last contact with the person infected with covid-19 quarantine can take place in a special facility outside of your home or at home."
7342,uaclvunMMcM.mp4,"If you can stay separated from family members why 14 days of quarantine, it can take from 1 to 14 days from contact with the virus to develop symptoms during this."
7343,uaclvunMMcM.mp4,You should stay in quarantine and monitor symptoms and follow instructions given to you.
7344,uaclvunMMcM.mp4,"If you become symptomatic without contact tracing and quarantine, the virus will continue to spread this leads to more people becoming sick and infecting the most vulnerable by identifying and limiting contacts of people infected with covid-19 the virus stop spreading and the community stays safe to break the chains of transmission."
7345,uaclvunMMcM.mp4,We all need to work together.
7346,uaclvunMMcM.mp4,If you become sick with covid-19 stay away from others.
7347,uaclvunMMcM.mp4,Follow the recommendations of your medical care provider and share the list of people who you came in close contact with with your help.
7348,uaclvunMMcM.mp4,We can prevent further spread of the virus and save more people's lives by acting together.
7349,uaclvunMMcM.mp4,We can break the chains of covid-19 transmission.
7350,iFLSG-7K3Tc.mp4,anyone anyone is thinking taking any chances just take a look at me.
7351,iFLSG-7K3Tc.mp4,I'm in the Intensive Care Unit.
7352,iFLSG-7K3Tc.mp4,I can't breathe without this.
7353,iFLSG-7K3Tc.mp4,they've had to so that into my artery.

7356,iFLSG-7K3Tc.mp4,Then you want still smokes put the cigarettes down because I'm telling you now you need your fucking lungs.
7357,iFLSG-7K3Tc.mp4,And please none of you take any chances.
7358,iFLSG-7K3Tc.mp4,I mean it because if it gets really bad.
7359,iFLSG-7K3Tc.mp4,And you're going to end up here.
7360,iFLSG-7K3Tc.mp4,Okay.
7361,iFLSG-7K3Tc.mp4,Thank you for all your lovely messages.
7362,iFLSG-7K3Tc.mp4,I really appreciate it.
7363,iFLSG-7K3Tc.mp4,And my body is fighting this I've not seen Richard.
7364,iFLSG-7K3Tc.mp4,I've not seen the girls since Friday and I'm just going to fight this.
7365,iFLSG-7K3Tc.mp4,"Say once again, don't take any chances."
7366,I5xas0lq6_4.mp4,National Institutes of Health is launching a study to learn more about how their coronavirus affects children while most kids have milder symptoms and adults not all do our senior medical correspondent.
7367,I5xas0lq6_4.mp4,Dr. Taryn Rule and now reports on what doctors hope to learn in the study.
7368,I5xas0lq6_4.mp4,I would never like picture me having to be in to be and being in the hospital 16 year-old.
7369,I5xas0lq6_4.mp4,Karla Duarte is a coronavirus Survivor the High School Junior from New York is one of the relatively few children in the u.s. To have severe complications from covid-19.
7370,I5xas0lq6_4.mp4,Her numbers were not improving her oxygen level was not improving doctors told Carlos mom Anna they had one treatment option left an ECMO machine which pumps and oxygenates the patient's blood outside the body when they told me about them.
7371,I5xas0lq6_4.mp4,"She and they said you know, this is 50/50 after seven days on ECMO and five more on a ventilator Carla's condition finally improved."
7372,I5xas0lq6_4.mp4,She was sent home after 21 days in the hospital.
7373,I5xas0lq6_4.mp4,You never had any medical problems before this.
7374,I5xas0lq6_4.mp4,"No serious cases, like Carla's are rare complicating the efforts of investigators."
7375,I5xas0lq6_4.mp4,"We have much less experience because the children are just getting less 6, so there are many fewer children interacting with the healthcare system and being tested."
7376,I5xas0lq6_4.mp4,Dr. Tina Harmons.
7377,I5xas0lq6_4.mp4,"Richard A. Vanderbilt school of medicine is leading a new NIH study remotely monitoring about 2,000 children and their families in 11 cities Nationwide."
7378,I5xas0lq6_4.mp4,She says that more data should be collected before a decision is made to send kids back to summer camp or school.
7379,I5xas0lq6_4.mp4,I think it's really risky to base decisions about this based on the fact that children get less sick from this virus because that does not equal children being less likely to transmit the virus.
7380,I5xas0lq6_4.mp4,We're not completely Your what are the risk factors for why these children get sick with covid?
7381,I5xas0lq6_4.mp4,Dr. Adrian Randolph is leaving a separate CDC funded study at Boston Children's Hospital.
7382,I5xas0lq6_4.mp4,What are some of the interesting or different presentations that you've seen in children with covid-19 at scattered reports what they're seeing is cardiac dysfunction so that their hearts not working as well as it should and abdominal pain is often part of the presentation twelve-year-old Juliet day.
7383,I5xas0lq6_4.mp4,Lee went into cardiac arrest after arriving at a New Orleans emergency room.
7384,I5xas0lq6_4.mp4,They had to do two minutes of CPR on her and then they got her back.
7385,I5xas0lq6_4.mp4,"Thank God, her mom says she tested positive for the coronavirus and another viral infection."
7386,I5xas0lq6_4.mp4,She was in the ICU for 10 days before recovering what message would you want to give other families regarding children and the risk of covid be vigilant?
7387,I5xas0lq6_4.mp4,Be careful?
7388,I5xas0lq6_4.mp4,It can become very severe in less than a day.
7389,I5xas0lq6_4.mp4,The New York City Department of Health says there are 15 children in the hospital with a very rare inflammatory syndrome that they're saying is potentially associated with the coronavirus.
7390,I5xas0lq6_4.mp4,It can evolve fever rash low blood pressure and inflammation of the blood vessels including the coronary arteries.
7391,I5xas0lq6_4.mp4,Boy Terra.
7392,I5xas0lq6_4.mp4,"So in one of the more fortunate aspects of this outbreak, is that although we have seen some severe cases children generally have more mild symptoms."
7393,I5xas0lq6_4.mp4,Do we know why?
7394,I5xas0lq6_4.mp4,It's really fascinating Tony and the experts say we don't there are a couple of theories one has to do with the fact that children may have less of those Ace receptors or less functional Ace receptors.
7395,I5xas0lq6_4.mp4,These are the receptors in the lungs that the virus attaches to and gets into the cells.
7396,I5xas0lq6_4.mp4,That may be why they don't get sick.
7397,I5xas0lq6_4.mp4,Another theory has to do with the fact that children are exposed all the time to lots of other coronavirus has the ones that cause the common cold so they may be developing antibodies to those that are cross reactive to covid-19.
7398,I5xas0lq6_4.mp4,"18 and therefore helping them and the last has to do with the fact that their immune system may be primed just right so they don't have that overwhelming cytokine storm and hyper reactive response that's causing a lot of adults to get into trouble with covid-19, but really lots of questions remain."
7399,I5xas0lq6_4.mp4,"Yeah, very interesting."
7400,I5xas0lq6_4.mp4,And of course we've had questions about the school year now also questions about summer camp.
7401,I5xas0lq6_4.mp4,That's a big one in my household Tara.

7423,9xXdF2CIHbc.mp4,Feeling foggy and acting differently.
7424,9xXdF2CIHbc.mp4,Those are some new warning signs when it comes to covid-19 News Channel five's Alexander Cohen learned the Center for Disease Control and prevention has added new symptoms to their list as doctors learn more about the virus and covid-19.
7425,9xXdF2CIHbc.mp4,They're seeing new symptoms like more people reporting being foggy or feeling confused.
7426,9xXdF2CIHbc.mp4,If that's the case.
7427,9xXdF2CIHbc.mp4,You need to seek medical help immediately at first covid-19 symptoms include fever cough.
7428,9xXdF2CIHbc.mp4,And shortness of breath but now several new symptoms have been added to the list including runny nose sore throat and congestion to name a few covid-19 differs from many respire ettore illnesses because we see complications and signs and symptoms outside of the respiratory tract warning signs now include chest pain confusion inability to wake up or stay awake and bluish lips or face.
7429,9xXdF2CIHbc.mp4,"They may lose part of their speech function or Vision or For example, but we also see changes in just the ability to think normally."
7430,9xXdF2CIHbc.mp4,So people may feel very foggy.
7431,9xXdF2CIHbc.mp4,Dr. David Aaron off the director of the division of infectious diseases at Vanderbilt says there's still a lot to learn regarding how covid-19 affects the brain sometimes Frank abnormal behavior and what we call encephalopathy or even loss of consciousness.
7432,9xXdF2CIHbc.mp4,While most patients in Tennessee don't require hospitalization in rare cases the virus can Lead to serious complications.
7433,9xXdF2CIHbc.mp4,We also see people even young people having Strokes as a result of covid-19 or having problems with blood clots some who are fighting covid-19 need amputations.
7434,9xXdF2CIHbc.mp4,It has to do with blood pressure lack of blood flow and oxygen issues.
7435,9xXdF2CIHbc.mp4,That's a significant minority of people who end up with these disastrous complications that we hear about while more studies are done to help experts understand covid-19.
7436,9xXdF2CIHbc.mp4,We can all do our part.
7437,9xXdF2CIHbc.mp4,"Heart to slow the spread reporting in Nashville, Alexandra Cohen NewsChannel5."
7438,9xXdF2CIHbc.mp4,"Thanks Alexandra right now, Tennessee in Tennessee."
7439,9xXdF2CIHbc.mp4,Dr. Aaron off says only six percent of people with covid-19 require hospitalization and just one out of every 100 patients in our state die from it.
7440,6xCaTD3Hpj0.mp4,More on the news of a potential covid-19 vaccine this morning joined now by the chair of the UK vaccine task force Kate Bingham.
7441,6xCaTD3Hpj0.mp4,Hello to miss bingum.
7442,6xCaTD3Hpj0.mp4,Thanks very much indeed for joining us on the program this morning.
7443,6xCaTD3Hpj0.mp4,This sounds exciting.
7444,6xCaTD3Hpj0.mp4,It is really cool.
7445,6xCaTD3Hpj0.mp4,Good buddy.
7446,6xCaTD3Hpj0.mp4,Tell me more about it.
7447,6xCaTD3Hpj0.mp4,"You know, it all sounds like good news."
7448,6xCaTD3Hpj0.mp4,"We have to temper our enthusiasm or should we just all get the streamers out now, we have to be very cautious because there has never been a vaccine against a current And a virus and there may never be one but we have been tasked to do is to protect the UK population against covid-19 through vaccination and do so as quickly as we can and the announcements this morning show that the UK is absolutely at the Forefront of global efforts to source and develop vaccines from across the world across a range of different Technologies."
7449,6xCaTD3Hpj0.mp4,"Scary, isn't it?"
7450,6xCaTD3Hpj0.mp4,"When you hear the might never be a vaccine against it, I don't think there's one against stars as a no and there's no Vaccine against malaria against HIV and these are diseases."
7451,6xCaTD3Hpj0.mp4,"We know well, so there is no expectation that this definitely can be done."
7452,6xCaTD3Hpj0.mp4,But the early data that we're seeing is definitely encouraging more trials in the works as well as it as not just the one are they working collaboratively together.
7453,6xCaTD3Hpj0.mp4,Yes.
7454,6xCaTD3Hpj0.mp4,So there's 23 vaccines in clinical trials around the world.
7455,6xCaTD3Hpj0.mp4,There has been enormous collaboration and cooperation both from Academia from industry from governments.
7456,6xCaTD3Hpj0.mp4,"It's Very impressive and people have been working at unprecedented speed so it is an exciting time and if you think about it, the virus was only identified at the beginning of the year and we've now got 23 vaccines in Trials Oxford as vaccinated over 9,000 people where they're with their vaccine."
7457,6xCaTD3Hpj0.mp4,So this is really quite remarkable.
7458,6xCaTD3Hpj0.mp4,Are we obliged obligated I should say to share our information to share our potential vaccines around the world.
7459,6xCaTD3Hpj0.mp4,"One of the goals of the vaccine task force is both to find vaccines for the UK, but also to ensure that any successful vaccine is distributed across the globe so that anybody who is at risk of covered infection is vaccinated."
7460,6xCaTD3Hpj0.mp4,So we're not pursuing a strategy of vaccine nationalism.
7461,6xCaTD3Hpj0.mp4,We are recognizing that this is a global pandemic and we need to ensure that the globe and all those who need it are vaccinated.
7462,6xCaTD3Hpj0.mp4,"Okay, so it's a breakthrough."
7463,6xCaTD3Hpj0.mp4,Day what happens next the trials continue.
7464,6xCaTD3Hpj0.mp4,So what we have announced today is that we've secured rights to two new vaccines in addition to the vaccines being developed by Oxford University and Imperial and those vaccines will continue to progress through clinical trials.
7465,6xCaTD3Hpj0.mp4,They have to show that they are both safe and they have to show that they are protective either that they can reduce mortality or ideally and ultimately we want to show that they can protect people I'm even getting infected in the first place and those trials basically will continue until we have a result.
7466,6xCaTD3Hpj0.mp4,How worried are you about Espionage people trying to hack a systems to steal the work that you've done and we've had continuous support from the cyber security teams that we have not been hacked.
7467,6xCaTD3Hpj0.mp4,"We're very alert to the fact that this is potentially happening, but it's not Concerned that this is going to disrupt in anyway, what we're doing has it been I mean, we've heard a lot about Russia trying to access what we what our brilliant scientists are doing."
7468,6xCaTD3Hpj0.mp4,Are you have you've obviously been made aware of that.
7469,6xCaTD3Hpj0.mp4,Have you actually seen it first hand as it were?
7470,6xCaTD3Hpj0.mp4,And soon the hacking after I've had lots of conversations with the cyber security teams.
7471,6xCaTD3Hpj0.mp4,Yes.
7472,6xCaTD3Hpj0.mp4,"Okay, as you said next steps mean that it's not yet a vaccine, but you are going to take it further to see whether or not we could go for herd immunity in the fullness of time with this vaccine, but I was reading an article this morning that suggested Kate that 25% of the population would not be interested in having a vaccine."
7473,6xCaTD3Hpj0.mp4,That's presumably because there Anxious about potentially being given covid-19 or whatever.
7474,6xCaTD3Hpj0.mp4,They're interpreting it as what would you say to reassure my viewers this morning?
7475,6xCaTD3Hpj0.mp4,So all I would suggest to the viewer sitting at their coffee tables having having breakfast is we are incredibly fortunate to be living in a world in which disease is not that long ago were killing millions of children.
7476,6xCaTD3Hpj0.mp4,So if you think about smallpox that has now been eradicated polio and so on if we can find vaccines that are safe and effective the restrictions that we are currently facing will stop we will return to normal vaccination has been a huge benefit to society.
7477,6xCaTD3Hpj0.mp4,30 and should continue to do so

7483,AOXt3jKr-TQ.mp4,What's the next three months might look like I think businesses will be cautious.
7484,AOXt3jKr-TQ.mp4,"China's influence in fashion has steadily increased over the last two decades with Chinese spending reported to account for one-third of the global luxury Market, but widening Restrictions have forced press influences and customers to stay away."

7488,vGOTq4H56To.mp4,Also new today the Centers for Disease Control is expanding the list of those most vulnerable to covid-19.
7489,vGOTq4H56To.mp4,"It's still mostly older adults and people with underlying medical conditions on that list, but in a more defined way when Lopez explains the CDC now releasing new information about who is most likely to suffer from severe covid-19 complications when it comes to age those most at risk are not just people over 65 as earlier reports.Did the CDC came out and said today that as you get older your risk goes up, so someone who's 50 has a risk greater than someone who's 40 and even the younger generation filling vulnerable experts say they make up the fastest growing group of new infections."
7490,vGOTq4H56To.mp4,I wanted to go out and have some fun with my friends and that's exactly what I did.
7491,vGOTq4H56To.mp4,It.
7492,vGOTq4H56To.mp4,Just so happened that I got Corona and now I'm suffering those consequences the CDC also points to evidence that medical conditions such as obesity and type 2 diabetes puts you at a higher risk for the disease experts say both of these conditions are among the most common in the US.
7493,vGOTq4H56To.mp4,We're now seeing a further delineation of what puts you at risk 11Alive medical correspondent.
7494,vGOTq4H56To.mp4,Dr. Sujatha.
7495,vGOTq4H56To.mp4,Ready says the more we learn about this virus the better we will be able to handle it.
7496,vGOTq4H56To.mp4,I think it's really good news that we're getting new information because it Shows we are learning from our past experiences that new information.
7497,vGOTq4H56To.mp4,Also pointing to pregnant women suggesting.
7498,vGOTq4H56To.mp4,"They may be at an increased risk bought in the past that you weren't at higher risk, and we're now thinking you might be again."
7499,vGOTq4H56To.mp4,"It's not a hundred percent, but I think it's always best to err on the side of caution."
7500,XfEPAi2g324.mp4,Hi / hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine has scientist trying to learn more to make sure it's safe and effective the FDA gave emergency approval for the use of the to malaria drugs to treat severe cases of covid-19.
7501,XfEPAi2g324.mp4,But the treatment strategy remained unproven there has been a lot of attention on some of these drugs called hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine because they work in a test tube essentially to have some activity at inhibiting.
7502,XfEPAi2g324.mp4,The growth of these viruses.
7503,XfEPAi2g324.mp4,"However, they've not been studied adequately in people who have had this infection."
7504,XfEPAi2g324.mp4,"And so there's a need for that these drugs are being made available for the treatment of a disease and yet we don't know if they actually do more good than harm Washington University School of Medicine in st. Louis has faculty members involved in a range of covid-19 response research, including investigating anti-malarial drugs every single one of us involved."
7505,XfEPAi2g324.mp4,With various aspects of the response to Chronic virus and some are involved with the actual direct patient care some are involved with the basic science and looking at new vaccine and treatment options in the laboratory others are involved with doing the clinical trials or the agents that look promising or need to be investigated in April colleagues of dr. Stephen Lawrence in the division of infectious diseases launched a clinical trial involving both.
7506,XfEPAi2g324.mp4,Ariel drugs fully controlled and what we call Gold Standard study is needed to be able to confirm if there is both safety and efficacy then in May the National Institutes of Health launched a clinical trial involving hydroxychloroquine in the cases of both clinical trials scientists are investigating combining the anti-malarials with the antibiotic azithromycin as if thrown Sin is used to treat many types of infections caused by bacteria including respiratory skin ear and eye infections as an antibiotic.
7507,XfEPAi2g324.mp4,I would not have expected.
7508,XfEPAi2g324.mp4,Is it for my sin to have any effect on a viral illness whether it does have an effect on a viral illness remains an open question and that is one of the reasons for conducting a study like this.
7509,XfEPAi2g324.mp4,Dr. Jeffrey Henderson is also part of the division of infectious diseases.
7510,XfEPAi2g324.mp4,His role in the covid-19 response is studying antibodies to the virus and coordinating a network for a plasma donations.
7511,XfEPAi2g324.mp4,He understands every possible treatment needs investigation with this particular agents.
7512,XfEPAi2g324.mp4,There's no firm a priori reason to believe that they would be active against for a viral infection for this reason.
7513,XfEPAi2g324.mp4,I think it's important to have good clinical trial data.
7514,XfEPAi2g324.mp4,On their safety and on their efficacy for covid-19 at Washington University.
7515,XfEPAi2g324.mp4,"The goal is to determine if any of these medications alone or in combination decrease the severity or duration of respiratory symptoms, you do use either hydroxychloroquine alone for clerk win alone, or you do use hydroxychloroquine plus the through my sin or chloroquine plus is a through mice and we have no idea if a combined approach is the best way to go about it."
7516,XfEPAi2g324.mp4,"That's why Why the clinical trials need to be done and are being done the drugs have known side effects, but researchers say patients involved are carefully screened and such effects are not typically seen for short-term."
7517,wkDVfGrJUPM.mp4,I will just this afternoon getting word.
7518,wkDVfGrJUPM.mp4,The FDA has given AstraZeneca the green light to restart its haunted covid-19 vaccine trial this being reported by The Wall Street Journal citing sources.
7519,wkDVfGrJUPM.mp4,We have not yet been able to confirm with the company or the FDA.
7520,wkDVfGrJUPM.mp4,"However, NBC News is Erika Edwards has been in touch with one of the doctors leading the trial the trial sites here in the United States who says they do not yet have the official green light from the FDA to start back up, but that is expected very soon and guys that jives with what I Heard from months of Slough we the head of operation warp-speed who told me based on the information."
7521,wkDVfGrJUPM.mp4,He's received.
7522,wkDVfGrJUPM.mp4,He does think that it would probably be an imminent go for AstraZeneca.
7523,wkDVfGrJUPM.mp4,"He said the same thing of Johnson & Johnson, but noted, of course that is up to the FDA and guys just now operation warp speed is actually conducting a briefing so we'll be waiting for any more potential news from them on that program that of course encapsulate snot just vaccines, but also the Therapeutics race and so we'll be listening for The updates potentially on the emergency use authorization applications for those antibody drugs from regeneron and Eli Lilly guys."
7524,wkDVfGrJUPM.mp4,Meg President Trump last night during the debate was asked for company specific names of which companies are ahead in the vet in the race for a vaccine given his optimism that we're going to get it.
7525,wkDVfGrJUPM.mp4,He says trial results within a few weeks.
7526,wkDVfGrJUPM.mp4,He mentioned I think Pfizer Johnson & Johnson moderna are those the three leading contenders right now.
7527,wkDVfGrJUPM.mp4,And when are we expecting that data?
7528,wkDVfGrJUPM.mp4,The First Data were expecting is potentially from Pfizer and its partner by on Tech.
7529,wkDVfGrJUPM.mp4,I mean they've said at the earliest they could have it by the end of October.
7530,wkDVfGrJUPM.mp4,So that would be next week.
7531,wkDVfGrJUPM.mp4,We'll have to see if the pace of the trial is actually going that quickly and if we get those data then moderna has been guiding to November J&J of course is still on pause as they investigate this unexplained illness in the trial and so they are a little bit further behind they also started their trial later.
7532,wkDVfGrJUPM.mp4,So I thought it was interesting the president Benson Johnson & Johnson first given That trial is still on pause.
7533,wkDVfGrJUPM.mp4,He also didn't mention the approval of REM Desi.
7534,wkDVfGrJUPM.mp4,"I thought that might have got a shout out last night Meg, but but but it didn't."
7535,wkDVfGrJUPM.mp4,"Yeah, it's interesting."
7536,wkDVfGrJUPM.mp4,"Well, I mean that was sort of a procedural approval."
7537,wkDVfGrJUPM.mp4,"You know, it does have the the moniker of being the first official drug approved for covid-19."
7538,wkDVfGrJUPM.mp4,"But at the same time it's already been out there and been on the market and the president has been much more excited about the antibody drugs, which he himself received in addition to room that severe."
7539,wkDVfGrJUPM.mp4,Of course Shepard Smith here.
7540,wkDVfGrJUPM.mp4,Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube.

7599,mAdwqHl7sac.mp4,There are a variety of breathing exercises that you can do that will quickly ground yourself in the midst of stress as well as anxiety.
7600,mAdwqHl7sac.mp4,So what you can do is find a chair that you feel comfortable in have your feet flat on the floor your hands resting comfortably on your lap and just take two deep breaths one in through your nose.
7601,mAdwqHl7sac.mp4,And after your mouth good one more into your nose.
7602,mAdwqHl7sac.mp4,And out through your mouth just gently seal your lips and allow your breath to return to its natural rhythm.
7603,mAdwqHl7sac.mp4,No more deep and no more shallow.
7604,mAdwqHl7sac.mp4,Just notice the air going in.
7605,mAdwqHl7sac.mp4,And the are going out.
7606,mAdwqHl7sac.mp4,noticing the cool air in And the cool air out?
7607,mAdwqHl7sac.mp4,You can do this for a few moments.
7608,mAdwqHl7sac.mp4,Noticing your chest rising and falling.
7609,mAdwqHl7sac.mp4,As a cool air is fully up your lungs.
7610,mAdwqHl7sac.mp4,And your chest falling as the air is leaving.
7611,mAdwqHl7sac.mp4,And those just few seconds can help you with that grounding that you might need to deal with that stress and or anxiety that you might be experiencing.
7612,d554SXwdTRA.mp4,"Late last year, we started to see a cluster of unusual pneumonia has come up in China."
7613,d554SXwdTRA.mp4,"And that's when we first started to get an indication that there might be some sort of new novel emerging infection that was going on and as we were following the progress of this cluster of unusual pneumonia illnesses in China, there was more information that it was evolving and then subsequently scientists were able to identify this novel coronavirus."
7614,d554SXwdTRA.mp4,Well with covid this novel coronavirus illness.
7615,d554SXwdTRA.mp4,We're seeing a lot of individuals with severe respiratory illnesses.
7616,d554SXwdTRA.mp4,"So a lot of the cases that we're seeing have fever shortness of breath cough a lot of lower respiratory tract illnesses, which are a little bit different a little bit more severe than what we've been seeing with your routine respiratory virus."
7617,d554SXwdTRA.mp4,Illnesses currently in the u.s. We are looking at different criteria for covid illnesses.
7618,d554SXwdTRA.mp4,And for now the criteria are looking at individuals with a history of exposure to like The Hot Zone hoobae Province in China or contact with individuals who are confirmed cases of covid and with clinical presentation of fever and respiratory tract.
7619,d554SXwdTRA.mp4,Illness that include fever cough shortness of breath currently the care is supportive.
7620,d554SXwdTRA.mp4,There are no treatments that are available for managing covid other than supportive care.
7621,d554SXwdTRA.mp4,"I'm treating the symptoms of this illness, you know as with other respiratory illnesses, we want to ensure that people followed those common-sense things that we do with for instance when we're in the middle of respiratory virus season cover."
7622,d554SXwdTRA.mp4,"Your cough making sure that you stay home when you're sick, making sure that you go see your healthcare provider if you're concerned about your health and to give a call to your healthcare provider ahead of time so that they can be prepared for your coming."
7623,AVy8EyjKsa0.mp4,I think that leaders need to be very aware of the extra strength that their employees are under as we go through covid-19 and I'm concerned that as we go through self-isolation when we go through this pandemic that employees could be harmed if their leaders aren't looking awesome.
7624,AVy8EyjKsa0.mp4,My name is Joel Klein and I'm a professor at Melbourne business school and Professor Sorel fellow at Melbourne medical school.
7625,AVy8EyjKsa0.mp4,I teach resilience leadership and decision-making.
7626,AVy8EyjKsa0.mp4,It's like every time we turn on the news Jill what can leaders do to support employee well-being.
7627,AVy8EyjKsa0.mp4,So I think a key thing for leaders to do is take some time to set your own priorities what's essential in this situation and what's not and then communicate that to your employees.
7628,AVy8EyjKsa0.mp4,What do you need than working on and what can you take off their plate when your employees simply cannot bear the brunt of this pandemic on your business?
7629,AVy8EyjKsa0.mp4,They're not Going to be able to show girls left.
7630,AVy8EyjKsa0.mp4,And so you need to do what you can to keep them focused on what's most important.
7631,AVy8EyjKsa0.mp4,What are the later is caught between bosses wanting things done and employees not having the full capacity to deliver.
7632,AVy8EyjKsa0.mp4,That's a very tight spot to be in and I have a feeling that a lot of you with finding ourselves in that position.
7633,AVy8EyjKsa0.mp4,And I think that what you have to do is you have to push back we have to push back upwards not downwards.
7634,AVy8EyjKsa0.mp4,Prioritize downwards push it up to the leaders above you and I know that's easier said than done.
7635,AVy8EyjKsa0.mp4,But one thing you can do is ask your leaders ask no bosses.
7636,AVy8EyjKsa0.mp4,What's most important to them try and encourage them to prioritize ask them?
7637,AVy8EyjKsa0.mp4,What is the most important thing that you need for me?
7638,AVy8EyjKsa0.mp4,"And my team's deliver by the end of this week or next week and try and get them to prioritize as well because again, it's just not possible for everyone."
7639,AVy8EyjKsa0.mp4,Do everything that they always used to do before all this?
7640,AVy8EyjKsa0.mp4,Is there anything else a leader can do to support the people working for them?
7641,AVy8EyjKsa0.mp4,Yes a lot of research on well-being and mental health tells us that experiencing positive emotion were going to adversity is very important.
7642,AVy8EyjKsa0.mp4,So you need to try to find Opportunities even remotely through team meetings to share a laugh and to support one another also.
7643,AVy8EyjKsa0.mp4,There's a great exercise that you can do and encourage your employees to do it's called the what went well exercise at the end of the day think of Three things that went well and why and write those three things down.
7644,AVy8EyjKsa0.mp4,Why does asking what went well affect people's well-being.
7645,AVy8EyjKsa0.mp4,So we evolved to pay attention to dangerous things because we had to be able to react to them very beautiful.
7646,AVy8EyjKsa0.mp4,"And so what that means is in our daily lives now, we will often pay more attention to negative things or potentially threatening things."
7647,AVy8EyjKsa0.mp4,So to the good things and what this exercise helps us do is get in the habit under Noticing positive things if you know that the end of the day you have to come up with three positive things you start looking for them and that helps us experience more positive emotion.
7648,AVy8EyjKsa0.mp4,It helps us notice the positives in life.
7649,677pSwGauqs.mp4,"The majority of transmission that we know about is that people who have symptoms transmit the virus to other people through infectious droplets, but there are a subset of people who don't develop symptoms and to truly understand how many people don't have since we don't actually have that answer yet."
7650,677pSwGauqs.mp4,"So when we say asymptomatic, we mean somebody that does not have symptoms and does not go on to develop symptoms truly no symptoms."
7651,677pSwGauqs.mp4,We know a number of them who are reported as asymptomatic actually may have mild disease.
7652,677pSwGauqs.mp4,They may go on to develop symptoms.
7653,677pSwGauqs.mp4,They may not quite register that I'm sick.
7654,677pSwGauqs.mp4,"You know, it's I just feel a little bit on."
7655,677pSwGauqs.mp4,"Well, I'm just a little bit under the weather of a feeling a little bit fatigued and some of those individuals we would classify as pre-symptomatic which means they have not yet developed symptoms."
7656,677pSwGauqs.mp4,"We know from some of the viral shedding studies from some of the lab work that there are people who are infected with covid-19 that can that can be PCR positive that can test positive one two, three days before they develop symptoms and that's something that we've known for quite some time."
7657,677pSwGauqs.mp4,Now what we need to better understand and this is one of the major unknowns is is What proportion is that is contributing to transmission.
7658,677pSwGauqs.mp4,"When you sing our you're shouting in a nightclub because you can't hear your friend and you're saying, you know, can you hear me and you're close by and you're projecting your voice at someone then it's clear that in that situation."
7659,677pSwGauqs.mp4,"If the virus is present in your upper respiratory mucosa, then there's every likelihood that you can project that virus."
7660,677pSwGauqs.mp4,The last couple of days have been the highest number of daily cases in the world.
7661,677pSwGauqs.mp4,"So in terms of pandemic generation, we are still very much on the up on the upward climb on this mountain, but what some countries have shown many countries are shown is if you go at this in a very systematic way and you use a comprehensive approach that there is enough stop ability in the virus."
7662,677pSwGauqs.mp4,We've seen that with the physical measures social distancing.
7663,677pSwGauqs.mp4,We've seen it with with sir.
7664,677pSwGauqs.mp4,Valence and we have some choices to make as a society because it is clear if we can identify cases and their contacts and we asked those contacts to quarantine themselves and we support them in that quarantine that that can be a very successful way of both stopping the disease and avoiding large scale luck tons of future.
7665,pZuJf8CNqw4.mp4,Researchers at the University of Nebraska Medical Center modeled a worst-case scenario in the US over the course of a year 96 million cases of covid-19 4.8 million hospitalizations almost a half million deaths scientists.
7666,pZuJf8CNqw4.mp4,Hope the measures the country is taking will keep the worst from happening.
7667,pZuJf8CNqw4.mp4,But the urgency of this moment has medical researchers all over the world racing.
7668,pZuJf8CNqw4.mp4,To find some way to fight the killer virus last month the National Institutes of Health tapped the Nebraska Medical Center to launch the first clinical trial in the u.s. Of an antiviral drug REM D severe which is administered intravenously to treat patients who have already contracted the virus.
7669,pZuJf8CNqw4.mp4,It's being tested against a placebo.
7670,pZuJf8CNqw4.mp4,It was actually studied in Ebola interestingly didn't work as well for Ebola.
7671,pZuJf8CNqw4.mp4,"However, there have been some animals."
7672,pZuJf8CNqw4.mp4,Eddie's as as well as some studies in the lab that demonstrate that it worked fairly well against illnesses like SARS and MERS which are also coronavirus has how does the drug work it inhibits replication of the virus.
7673,pZuJf8CNqw4.mp4,And so when a virus would normally try to reproduce itself this drug inserts itself into that process and then stops viral replication.
7674,pZuJf8CNqw4.mp4,So it stops reproduction of the virus this clinical trial is up and running in the middle of this outbreak.
7675,pZuJf8CNqw4.mp4,I will say this is the Artist clinical trial that I've ever seen come to fruition in this amount of time ordinarily.
7676,pZuJf8CNqw4.mp4,How long would it take to get a trial up and running that can that can range from many months to two years?

7778,A8zT1-U2Zlo.mp4,Hi and welcome to another edition of your health with dr. Christie.
7779,A8zT1-U2Zlo.mp4,My name is dr. Christie Reisinger.
7780,A8zT1-U2Zlo.mp4,And today I'd like to speak to all the parents out there worried about covid-19 and your kids.
7781,A8zT1-U2Zlo.mp4,I personally have four children myself and I understand that overwhelming concern and fear that we all have about protecting our children.
7782,A8zT1-U2Zlo.mp4,I'd like to give you guys the most recent updates but help you realize that the data is coming in at rapid speeds and often changes.
7783,A8zT1-U2Zlo.mp4,"We've always known that children of all ages can contract covid-19, but often their symptoms are either not at all or mild or moderate."
7784,A8zT1-U2Zlo.mp4,"They usually recover within one to two week, but we have seen infants younger than one year of age and children with underlying conditions having more severe infections."
7785,A8zT1-U2Zlo.mp4,Most of the initial covid-19 cases in children were contracted with household exposure or due to recent travel the most common symptoms are fever and cough.
7786,A8zT1-U2Zlo.mp4,But many many other symptoms can occur as well such as gastrointestinal symptoms like diarrhea data up until April 13th showed that less than 5% of cases of covid-19 were in children ages 0 to 18 years of age there have been a few theories about why children overall have experienced less symptoms of covid-19.
7787,A8zT1-U2Zlo.mp4,"We think it may be due to their naive immune systems immaturity of the ace to receptors, which is the Gateway for stars Covey to get into the cells and replicate underdeveloped immune responses because of their young age or because children get recurrent viral infections during childhood their immunoglobulins, maybe higher and therefore more protective against a novel virus such as the novel coronavirus, but recently 73 children in New York state and about 20 or so other children around the United States have been diagnosed with an illness."
7788,A8zT1-U2Zlo.mp4,Associated with covid-19.
7789,A8zT1-U2Zlo.mp4,It's being called pediatric multi-symptom inflammatory syndrome this syndrome occurs after recovery from covid-19 and interestingly enough.
7790,A8zT1-U2Zlo.mp4,Some of the children have had no symptoms of covid-19.
7791,A8zT1-U2Zlo.mp4,Most of these children are healthy and we think it's occurring because of an immune response in these children that's overly aggressive meaning that the antibodies that have been produced after exposure to covid-19.
7792,A8zT1-U2Zlo.mp4,19 go on and continue to attack the children's bodies.
7793,A8zT1-U2Zlo.mp4,This syndrome is not contagious.
7794,A8zT1-U2Zlo.mp4,"It has features similar to Kawasaki disease, which is a disease that causes inflammation of the blood vessels taking blood back to the heart."
7795,A8zT1-U2Zlo.mp4,"It also has features similar to toxic shock syndrome, which can cause low blood pressure and rash the patients that we know about so far are between the ages of two to 15 have all been healthy have had Obvious symptoms of covid-19 the symptoms that have been seen with a syndrome are persistent fever abdominal pain vomiting diarrhea a rash anywhere on the body including the palms and the soles of the feet conjunctivitis or red irritated eyes and enlarged lymph node on one side of the neck red cracked lips or a swollen tongue that looks like a strawberry or swollen hands or feet."
7796,A8zT1-U2Zlo.mp4,Eat if your child is exhibiting these symptoms call your pediatrician immediately these children have been treated in the hospital and most recover.
7797,A8zT1-U2Zlo.mp4,I do want to emphasize that this syndrome is very very rare.
7798,A8zT1-U2Zlo.mp4,We're going to continue to learn more about it in the months to come.
7799,A8zT1-U2Zlo.mp4,"But at this point, it's thought to be a post infectious syndrome."
7800,A8zT1-U2Zlo.mp4,Thanks again for joining me.

7816,_J60fQr0GWo.mp4,"It's a little another thing I think in most pneumonia, but the amount of then than flu because most people get pneumonia and and as I said before it's a very severe pneumonia and so it's a massive massive strength for for a every health system because we see everyday 50 to 60 pages."
7817,_J60fQr0GWo.mp4,Patients who come to our emergency department pneumonia and most of them are so severe they they need very high fio2 or oxygen and so it's we have to reorganize our emergency room and our Hospital in three levels of intensity as you do so.
7818,_J60fQr0GWo.mp4,This is the main hospital in Bergamo In Lombardi Province.
7819,_J60fQr0GWo.mp4,"It's one of the most advanced hospitals in Europe, but it's the most hard-hit of all the hospitals in Italy the town is the center of the epidemic here."
7820,_J60fQr0GWo.mp4,This isn't a ward.
7821,_J60fQr0GWo.mp4,This is a waiting room wherever you go people are on Gurney's in corridors in meeting rooms there every way.
7822,_J60fQr0GWo.mp4,All the medical staff urge other nations to see what's happening and lock their Nations down right now or face this what it was suggested just shut down to stop all the Heartbreak and not coming this kind of situation.
7823,_J60fQr0GWo.mp4,That is very very difficult to manage.
7824,_J60fQr0GWo.mp4,Crash you personally what it's been like I never filled so stress in my life.
7825,_J60fQr0GWo.mp4,"I'm an intensivist than I quite used to, you know, intense moment and choices and people are critical and will die without any, you know treatment and you make the difference."
7826,_J60fQr0GWo.mp4,But when you arrive at this point you realize that you are not enough and maybe all the We are 100 an ester this year.
7827,_J60fQr0GWo.mp4,We are doing our best but maybe is not is not enough.
7828,_J60fQr0GWo.mp4,We are performing the task for the nasal swab to detect coronavirus the problem facing Health Services across the world is that when the infection curve goes up it rockets and all the resources all the testing all the supplies are used up instantly multiple hospitals.
7829,_J60fQr0GWo.mp4,Little ones.
7830,_J60fQr0GWo.mp4,"What staggering is it Italy is doing a lot a lot of testing thousands upon thousands of being tested so far about 4,000 the numbers keep changes have actually completely recovered The crucial point."
7831,_J60fQr0GWo.mp4,Is that about the same number a die?
7832,_J60fQr0GWo.mp4,They're sort of neck and neck and it seems you either live and recover or you die.
7833,_J60fQr0GWo.mp4,something nobody special Donna wanted us to see this to show what a catastrophic emergency.
7834,_J60fQr0GWo.mp4,Nobody has experienced before looks like here they're calling it The Apocalypse and this is what it looks like their message to us is simple get ready.
7835,_J60fQr0GWo.mp4,"Still Ramsey Sky News Bergamo, Italy."
7836,cytI7bb9hX0.mp4,Dr. Teresa Tam is Canada's Chief Public Health officer.
7837,cytI7bb9hX0.mp4,And she joins us now.
7838,cytI7bb9hX0.mp4,Dr. Tam the Center for Disease Control and the United States says it's not a matter of if but when covid-19 the coronavirus becomes a global pandemic.
7839,cytI7bb9hX0.mp4,What is your take on that?
7840,cytI7bb9hX0.mp4,"Well right now Canada is doing very well still in identify cases in Travelers and managing the close contacts with a lot of work from public health, but I think that it is very important for us to prepare forSo onward transmission and spread within Canada."
7841,cytI7bb9hX0.mp4,You said the signs are concerning they mean that the window of opportunity for containment that is for stopping the global spread of the virus is closing elaborate on that.
7842,cytI7bb9hX0.mp4,What does that mean?
7843,cytI7bb9hX0.mp4,"Well, I think oh eyes have been on China which is the epicenter of the outbreak but outside of China."
7844,cytI7bb9hX0.mp4,"There's now increasing number of countries where they were reporting sizable outbreaks and where there's some ongoing Community transmission, which Which tells me that the virus is spreading in different regions of the world."
7845,cytI7bb9hX0.mp4,These countries are still going to have a go at trying to stop the spread.
7846,cytI7bb9hX0.mp4,But I think that right now there's opportunity for us is to use it as wisely as possible to get prepared for any eventual scenarios.
7847,cytI7bb9hX0.mp4,Okay.
7848,cytI7bb9hX0.mp4,"Well, let's say it becomes a global pandemic because it's in Italy."
7849,cytI7bb9hX0.mp4,"It's in South Korea as you say the number of countries are growing is Canada prepared for Endemic, what do we do differently than now?"
7850,cytI7bb9hX0.mp4,"Well, we've had quite a lot of experience already and we have Pandemic preparedness plans and response plans at the sort of system or health system level."
7851,cytI7bb9hX0.mp4,So that means looking out our existing surveillance system.
7852,cytI7bb9hX0.mp4,We talked about influenza.
7853,cytI7bb9hX0.mp4,We use similar surveillance systems for Respiratory illnesses and viruses and Laboratories.
7854,cytI7bb9hX0.mp4,We got the diagnostic tests.
7855,cytI7bb9hX0.mp4,"We need to be able to sort of spread it out so that there's more capacity in Canada most Portly though the health system needs to depend on its foundational infection prevention control measures and but when there's a lot of patients like sometimes in a bad flu season, we need to prioritize your resources."
7856,cytI7bb9hX0.mp4,You need to look at business continuity.
7857,cytI7bb9hX0.mp4,"So the health system needs to prepare from that perspective long-term care facilities given that a number of the patients who are seriously ill like more likely to be the older age group, but should we recalibrate what's happening at the borders?"
7858,cytI7bb9hX0.mp4,Like should we think of if it's a pandemic do we close borders?
7859,cytI7bb9hX0.mp4,Do we shut things down?
7860,cytI7bb9hX0.mp4,Like other countries are doing it maybe sort of anti intuitive for people to understand this but the more more countries that impacted means that your border measures going to be much less effective and definitely not feasible.
7861,cytI7bb9hX0.mp4,"So we are sort of essentially focusing on General messaging to all travelers particularly if you're going to countries impacted by the coronavirus, but In general you need to prepare before you travel during and definitely when you come back monitor your symptoms disappear."
7862,cytI7bb9hX0.mp4,"How like I'm some somebody saying, okay."
7863,cytI7bb9hX0.mp4,"So someone says well if it's a pandemic prepare, I read things online people said, I've got to get water 72 hours of water."
7864,cytI7bb9hX0.mp4,I'd better get masks.
7865,cytI7bb9hX0.mp4,Are you should Canadian start thinking about buying masks if the or the ones that actually work if they do work.
7866,cytI7bb9hX0.mp4,"Well, that's some general aspects of preventing yourself from getting sick and we all know what those are right, sir."
7867,cytI7bb9hX0.mp4,"Avoiding people of illness, but when you're sick, definitely stay at home cover your cough wash your hands a lot and we can't repeat that too many too frequently."
7868,cytI7bb9hX0.mp4,"But at home, let's just think about this if someone is sick know how to prepare to look after someone who's sick while preventing yourself from getting sick through hand washing through cleaning of surfaces one part bleach nine-part water does the trick and cleaning your home services, make sure you have supplies cover your car."
7869,cytI7bb9hX0.mp4,Cough for that you need tissues.
7870,cytI7bb9hX0.mp4,You need to discard things properly.
7871,cytI7bb9hX0.mp4,You can actually distance yourself from someone who's sick.
7872,cytI7bb9hX0.mp4,"You don't necessarily have to equip yourself and stock up on also serve, you know, personal protective equipment, but there's simple things you can do but the other thing plane, let's March break coming up people."
7873,cytI7bb9hX0.mp4,Are you advising people to wear a mask and are those masks in any way effective in stopping the coronavirus?
7874,cytI7bb9hX0.mp4,So I think we are the vising people not to just generally walk about wearing masks that's not going to be effective.
7875,cytI7bb9hX0.mp4,But if Sick say someone who is experiencing symptoms putting a mask on the sick person to prevent the transmission from the sick person is smart thing to do.
7876,cytI7bb9hX0.mp4,"But otherwise again all those other measures to keep, you know, hand-washing and everything else, but the the other things that you just talked about being prepared to stock up on your medications, even when you're traveling, but certainly when you're at home if you have underlying medical conditions, Knowing who to call should you get sick your social networks, looking after your parents or your grandparents and others."
7877,cytI7bb9hX0.mp4,So so make sure you know how to have all those arrangements but work arrangements to so if workplaces are disrupted because of illness they need business continuity plans.
7878,cytI7bb9hX0.mp4,"Well the ways to work telework Arrangements, but trying to keep people at home if they're sick is very important to keep the virus from workplaces daughter Tamara."
7879,cytI7bb9hX0.mp4,Really?
7880,cytI7bb9hX0.mp4,Appreciate you joining us.
7881,cytI7bb9hX0.mp4,Thank you.
7882,cytI7bb9hX0.mp4,Thank you.
7883,XfdjLQV-fSs.mp4,Hello there.
7884,XfdjLQV-fSs.mp4,My name is dr. Ram you Letty and the chief physician executive at Community Health Network want to give a brief update today about all the activity that's going on with covid-19.
7885,XfdjLQV-fSs.mp4,I know there's a lot of anxiety a lot of questions a lot of concerns and so want to kind of lay out what's going on and what we think we should be doing at this time.
7886,XfdjLQV-fSs.mp4,First and foremost is many of you baby.
7887,XfdjLQV-fSs.mp4,Maybe understand the who recently said his now pandemic.
7888,XfdjLQV-fSs.mp4,What a pandemic means is that there is a newHe's in the world.
7889,XfdjLQV-fSs.mp4,That's affecting the majority of countries and is continuing to be transmitted from person to person.
7890,XfdjLQV-fSs.mp4,One of the main reasons that the who has declared pandemic they stated is that they are very concerned that there's a significant amount of inaction in terms of what we're doing to deal with it.
7891,XfdjLQV-fSs.mp4,"So let me explain that because I know some of you are thinking well, what do you mean an action sounds like we're going overboard The Other Extreme."
7892,XfdjLQV-fSs.mp4,So the biggest issue about about covid-19 is that there's a new infection for which we have no treatment.
7893,XfdjLQV-fSs.mp4,"And so for those people that are most vulnerable and I mean people that are older than 60 if you get covid-19 infection, if you end up getting a pneumonia, we don't have any treatments for it."
7894,XfdjLQV-fSs.mp4,We don't have any antibiotics antiviral medications.
7895,XfdjLQV-fSs.mp4,All we could do is what's called supportive care and hope your body can fight the disease and recover from it.
7896,XfdjLQV-fSs.mp4,So that's the reason why it's so critical.
7897,XfdjLQV-fSs.mp4,"We already know studies from China and Japan if you're really below age 30 or below each 50, you're not going to get sick."
7898,XfdjLQV-fSs.mp4,"You're not going to die from it, and we already know that so it's not about it."
7899,XfdjLQV-fSs.mp4,Is it going to affect me but it's about me and everybody else are going to be affecting.
7900,XfdjLQV-fSs.mp4,So the reason we're trying to be so aggressive with this is to try to minimize.
7901,XfdjLQV-fSs.mp4,The number of people that are the elderly are going to get sick from it.
7902,XfdjLQV-fSs.mp4,And so the more aggressive we could be early on.
7903,XfdjLQV-fSs.mp4,Hopefully they'll be less patients that actually end up having problems with it at the end.
7904,XfdjLQV-fSs.mp4,So it's the transmission of the disease that we really want to minimize.
7905,XfdjLQV-fSs.mp4,"So people that have children or feeling otherwise healthy thinking well, what do I need to do the most important thing to do if you're having symptoms of flu like illness or cough or colder temperature?"
7906,XfdjLQV-fSs.mp4,"Is it is restrained yourself is seclude yourself, whether your child middle-aged any age so you don't spread the disease again all children and I'll most adults will get through just fine."
7907,XfdjLQV-fSs.mp4,But the most important you can do for society is to make sure the elderly don't get this infection or people have other significant health problems last series.
7908,XfdjLQV-fSs.mp4,"We'll try and do this is that if we don't do this this will rapidly spread and we're going to have significant issues trying to take care of these people for as matter of as a point of fact and Italy right now, there's so many elderly that have been infected they're running."
7909,XfdjLQV-fSs.mp4,The ventilators to help with those people just in the city of Indianapolis yesterday.
7910,XfdjLQV-fSs.mp4,"There was a several hour meeting where all the Indianapolis clinicians came together and deciding if we can run the same situation when we run out of ventilators, how do we ration the ventilators what I'm hoping, you know, if we could at all possible is prevent this and prevent the spread of disease so we don't reach that point."
7911,XfdjLQV-fSs.mp4,So we're urging people is to use common sense.
7912,XfdjLQV-fSs.mp4,If you have symptoms stay inside keep yourself secluded until the symptoms go away and if we could do that early on in be very Rod about it that hopefully will spread limit the spread of the disease and the potential mortality from the disease.
7913,1PLdl6NDGDE.mp4,Welcome to this MIT Mastery coronavirus update.
7914,1PLdl6NDGDE.mp4,I'm fancy Spa.
7915,1PLdl6NDGDE.mp4,I'm an internist trained in epidemiology and Public Health at Johns Hopkins and the founder of McMaster e what we teach important clinical skills to doctors and other health care providers around the world today.
7916,1PLdl6NDGDE.mp4,We're going to talk about the symptoms associated with covid-19.
7917,1PLdl6NDGDE.mp4,They're quite a bit different from a regular cold.
7918,1PLdl6NDGDE.mp4,Let's see how The disease seems to stop with a fever followed by a dry cough around 80% of confirmed cases are mild and can stay home.
7919,1PLdl6NDGDE.mp4,Whereas 20% a more severe and need impatient care due to the pneumonia and its consequences caused by the virus.
7920,1PLdl6NDGDE.mp4,"What's interesting is that covid-19 only rarely seems to cause a runny nose sneezing or even a sore throat, even though the sore throat seems to be a little more common."
7921,1PLdl6NDGDE.mp4,These symptoms commonly observed and regular codes have been observed in only about 5% of covid-19 patients.
7922,1PLdl6NDGDE.mp4,A paper published by Chen and co-workers in the respected journal the Lancet describe the clinical course of ninety-nine cases hospitalized for stars Covey to Associated pneumonia.
7923,1PLdl6NDGDE.mp4,They found that fever and cough where the most common symptoms of covid-19 followed by shortness of breath.
7924,1PLdl6NDGDE.mp4,So the classical symptoms of pneumonia seem to be dominant in these patients.
7925,1PLdl6NDGDE.mp4,Seventeen percent of patients in their study treated for covid-19 developed acute respiratory distress syndrome or a RDS a severe complication of covid-19 and other pathogens and had to be mechanically ventilated.
7926,1PLdl6NDGDE.mp4,Three percent received extracorporeal membrane oxygenation or ECMO and 11% died from the disease.
7927,1PLdl6NDGDE.mp4,These numbers are comparable to those of other Publications.
7928,1PLdl6NDGDE.mp4,And remember these are numbers from hospitalized patients.
7929,1PLdl6NDGDE.mp4,Not the general covid-19 population.
7930,1PLdl6NDGDE.mp4,So that's it for now.

7935,Icr7xADIoas.mp4,Worldwide this morning growing concern over a growing Health crisis with health officials here in the US moving fast to prepare for what the CDC has called an inevitable spread.
7936,Icr7xADIoas.mp4,"We are right now in a very active containment mode thousands of Americans Nationwide already under voluntary self quarantine after returning from China, even though they don't pose any immediate risk, the US has faced outbreaks before from SARS in 2003, which killed at least 874 globally to the H1N1 virus in 2009 which had an estimated Global death toll of at least 150 1000 both outbreaks providing the government a roadmap as it navigates the days and months ahead at Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago."
7937,Icr7xADIoas.mp4,Dr. Benjamin singer says they're on alert for Coronavirus even as the ER and ICU are filled with patients recovering from the seasonal flu.
7938,Icr7xADIoas.mp4,How do you distinguish between coronavirus and the typical flu?
7939,Icr7xADIoas.mp4,Can be a challenge when a patient first presents for care because the symptoms overlap quite a bit.
7940,Icr7xADIoas.mp4,That's why we pay a lot attention to their history where they've travelled and the people with whom they've been in contact.
7941,Icr7xADIoas.mp4,Meanwhile US Health screenings continue at select US airports.
7942,Icr7xADIoas.mp4,The CDC is Distributing new test kits to Public Health Labs Nationwide as early as next week ensuring there are enough supplies on hand including surgical masks and gowns First Responders now training to identify possible cases.
7943,Icr7xADIoas.mp4,"In Pittsburgh, they've been given personal protection kits Health experts though insist and outbreak will look nothing."
7944,Icr7xADIoas.mp4,Like what's been depicted in Hollywood movies when we run out of body bags like contagion in 2011.
7945,Icr7xADIoas.mp4,It will look and feel to the American people more like a severe flu season in terms of the interventions and approaches.
7946,Icr7xADIoas.mp4,You see President Trump says he'll do whatever is necessary.
7947,Icr7xADIoas.mp4,Even if that means following China's lead and quarantine entire cities.
7948,Icr7xADIoas.mp4,We do have plans at all.
7949,Icr7xADIoas.mp4,Just gave we need it.
7950,Icr7xADIoas.mp4,We don't think we're going to need it.
7951,Icr7xADIoas.mp4,"But you know, you always have to be prepared prepared to take every precaution while facing a new and unfamiliar disease and Tom even on the way down here flying down here a couple of people had those face masks masks on so it got me wondering a lot of folks wondering are they a good idea that they do they do anything?"
7952,Icr7xADIoas.mp4,Yeah.
7953,Icr7xADIoas.mp4,So I asked dr. Singer here at Northwestern that very question and and he referred me to the CDC guidance which has if you are sick or if Somebody in your family is sick.
7954,Icr7xADIoas.mp4,Then this makes a good idea.
7955,Icr7xADIoas.mp4,Right because you wanted to avoid spreading the germs it's less effective.
7956,Icr7xADIoas.mp4,If you're simply trying to avoid getting sick by going through an airport or a bus station or whatever else.
7957,Icr7xADIoas.mp4,This may not be that helpful.
7958,Icr7xADIoas.mp4,What is helpful is to constantly wash your hands don't touch your face.
7959,Icr7xADIoas.mp4,"And if you're in a clinical environment take advantage of the hand sanitizer, you know, all of us here in the ER have been doing this constantly both yesterday and today."
7960,Icr7xADIoas.mp4,You mention the CDC Tom.
7961,Icr7xADIoas.mp4,There's news this morning that they're they're changing their criteria for testing patients.
7962,Icr7xADIoas.mp4,After that first case of Unknown Origin in the US was confirmed.
7963,Icr7xADIoas.mp4,What more can you tell us about that?
7964,Icr7xADIoas.mp4,"Yeah, and this is critical right because up until now they were separating these cases out by simply by the travel history."
7965,Icr7xADIoas.mp4,But now if this disease is spreading on its own in the United States that no longer is enough.
7966,Icr7xADIoas.mp4,So they're now going to be pushing 93 test kits to Labs across cross the country by this weekend so that there will be a quicker way to diagnose somebody with coronavirus.
7967,Icr7xADIoas.mp4,Meanwhile 70 companies are competing with finding a some sort of a diagnostic test for hospitals to use at the bedside so that you don't have to necessarily send those out to a lab.
7968,Icr7xADIoas.mp4,But absolutely the whole Spectrum here is opening up if this is now Out Among the population as opposed to a simple travel history alone.
7969,KhGNzPRsCO0.mp4,"Back to our main story this morning, which is the coronavirus crisis and turning to the NBA a sports angle to all of this because of preparations that they're making Rob Pizzo walk."
7970,KhGNzPRsCO0.mp4,Yeah exactly.
7971,KhGNzPRsCO0.mp4,What this is.
7972,KhGNzPRsCO0.mp4,"There are looking towards a possible worst case scenario and the NBA sent out a memo to every team yesterday saying get your preparations ready for possibly playing with no fans and no media, John and other words what they're calling only essential staff."
7973,KhGNzPRsCO0.mp4,They also sent out.
7974,KhGNzPRsCO0.mp4,Plans for the possibility of the media may be attending but still no fans.
7975,KhGNzPRsCO0.mp4,"Now the NBA is not saying they're going to do this for sure, but they are saying they want to get a plan in place just in case we've seen this already over in Europe a couple soccer games were played with no fans."
7976,KhGNzPRsCO0.mp4,It's certainly strange to see it's got to be strange for the players to actually play in as well.
7977,KhGNzPRsCO0.mp4,And when this new started to break obviously people want to know what players thought of it.
7978,KhGNzPRsCO0.mp4,And there's one of those players right there and LeBron James after his game against Milwaukee.
7979,KhGNzPRsCO0.mp4,"Well, he said this I ain't playing I got the fans any cross while playful way for my teammates play for our play for the fans."
7980,KhGNzPRsCO0.mp4,That's what it's all about.
7981,KhGNzPRsCO0.mp4,"So if I show up to Arena ain't no fans in there, I ain't playing so they can do what they want to do."
7982,KhGNzPRsCO0.mp4,If only LeBron James would come out of his shell and tell us what he really thinks.
7983,KhGNzPRsCO0.mp4,Obviously.
7984,KhGNzPRsCO0.mp4,I understand why he's doing that.
7985,KhGNzPRsCO0.mp4,He's trying to say I'm here for the fans.
7986,KhGNzPRsCO0.mp4,"I want to put on a show, but also I understand what the NBA is doing."
7987,KhGNzPRsCO0.mp4,"They don't want to create a 20,000 person petri dish with This virus is going around and they've been pretty proactive."
7988,KhGNzPRsCO0.mp4,Don't forget.
7989,KhGNzPRsCO0.mp4,They sent out that memo last week with different tips for the NBA players to not get sick.
7990,KhGNzPRsCO0.mp4,Don't be shaking fans hands.
7991,KhGNzPRsCO0.mp4,"Don't be taking pens from them to sign autographs, you know, obviously do the fist pump do the elbow pump do whatever you got to do, but they obviously don't want it to infiltrate."
7992,KhGNzPRsCO0.mp4,"But again, they're not saying they're going to do this."
7993,KhGNzPRsCO0.mp4,They're certainly planning for the possibility of basketball games without fans.
7994,KhGNzPRsCO0.mp4,Yeah surreal.
7995,KhGNzPRsCO0.mp4,Just the squeak of rubber on hardwood vinyl here.
7996,KhGNzPRsCO0.mp4,Yeah with an echo going across the arena.
7997,KhGNzPRsCO0.mp4,"No, thanks, Rob."
7998,KhGNzPRsCO0.mp4,Thank you.
7999,YwrDP_l1AIM.mp4,"Well, as time has gone by we're learning more about the virus and more about the syndrome that it causes when people become infected with it."
8000,YwrDP_l1AIM.mp4,We know now which receptors the virus needs to get into a cell and we can tell where in a person's body.
8001,YwrDP_l1AIM.mp4,They are more likely to express these receptors and higher numbers and that is somewhat allowed us to predict the type of symptoms people will have and sure enough we've seen through experience.
8002,YwrDP_l1AIM.mp4,"They are having these additional symptoms.Classic ones you'll hear about are fevers and any kind of respiratory symptoms like shortness of breath or cough or anything that involves the lungs, but we also know that people are likely to express these receptors in the mouth and the throat and in the GI tract so we have seen people get sore throat some kinds of GI upset diarrhea."
8003,YwrDP_l1AIM.mp4,Sometimes we also know these receptors are expressed on the heart and sometimes people get inflammation.
8004,YwrDP_l1AIM.mp4,None of the heart tissue itself and some chest pains.
8005,YwrDP_l1AIM.mp4,So we've even had some people present with what they thought was a heart attack.
8006,YwrDP_l1AIM.mp4,"And in fact, it was inflammation of some of the heart tissue that caused by the virus itself."
8007,YwrDP_l1AIM.mp4,"We also know that people can have some effect in the nerves around the face that can cause an alteration and smell or an alteration in taste and some people have noticed some skin changes, although that is been a little less specific the vast majority."
8008,YwrDP_l1AIM.mp4,"Atia people will still have fever and some sort of respiratory symptom and frequently achiness like you have any kind of viral syndrome, but over time we are seeing some of these additional symptoms the other one that has been far less often, but could be predicted from again where we see this receptor being expressed is inflammation of the testes orchitis, and we have seen some symptoms of that over time as well."
8009,dEgmTCWG_w8.mp4,"Scott exponentially worse, you know scratchy throat breathing her."
8010,dEgmTCWG_w8.mp4,"I mean, I don't think I've ever had that type of pain."
8011,dEgmTCWG_w8.mp4,There's a hundred 3.2 every 6 hours after that.
8012,dEgmTCWG_w8.mp4,It was a hundred me one degrees for 4 days 4 days and I was getting really lethargic.
8013,dEgmTCWG_w8.mp4,I couldn't think straight I couldn't do anything.
8014,dEgmTCWG_w8.mp4,I would just like doze off while standing up.
8015,dEgmTCWG_w8.mp4,I almost fell over a few times hurts so bad.
8016,dEgmTCWG_w8.mp4,I mean like in my bones this is stuff that happened in your that happens in your head because you don't know what's going on.
8017,dEgmTCWG_w8.mp4,You feel terrible.
8018,dEgmTCWG_w8.mp4,You can't move you can barely breathe.
8019,dEgmTCWG_w8.mp4,If you can't even keep your eyes open for that long.
8020,dEgmTCWG_w8.mp4,"It's just it's just terrible most coughing in the bathroom it I don't even know how you would explain it in this manner, but I got so bad in five minutes."
8021,dEgmTCWG_w8.mp4,I was coughing up blood.
8022,dEgmTCWG_w8.mp4,I had the bloody nose.
8023,dEgmTCWG_w8.mp4,I passed out fell down to my knees on the ground and I was worried if I was going to live.
8024,dEgmTCWG_w8.mp4,So I woke her up and started telling her we need to write a will.
8025,dEgmTCWG_w8.mp4,Then I was rough.
8026,dEgmTCWG_w8.mp4,That's four days after that.
8027,dEgmTCWG_w8.mp4,We weren't sure.
8028,dEgmTCWG_w8.mp4,There's all this down in Sacramento only had 25 tests for the entire group that of doctors that was their 25 and she says the rest were on back order.
8029,dEgmTCWG_w8.mp4,They go through my mom for a few weeks without telling her if she's positive or not.
8030,dEgmTCWG_w8.mp4,So we also started to get worried there and then when it finally came back and it and they said that she had tested positive I could actually feel my heart sing.
8031,dEgmTCWG_w8.mp4,So we were left with no money.
8032,dEgmTCWG_w8.mp4,We were left with nothing.
8033,dEgmTCWG_w8.mp4,We got sick before the whole pandemic actually got supercharged.
8034,dEgmTCWG_w8.mp4,So while we were down everybody else is buying toilet paper and food and everything and we sat here for two weeks with no toilet paper.
8035,dEgmTCWG_w8.mp4,No food.
8036,dEgmTCWG_w8.mp4,No phone calls.
8037,dEgmTCWG_w8.mp4,No answers.
8038,dEgmTCWG_w8.mp4,No nothing.
8039,dEgmTCWG_w8.mp4,Nothing.
8040,dEgmTCWG_w8.mp4,Not one person from the health department not our doctor.
8041,dEgmTCWG_w8.mp4,No one we have to call her to get updates.
8042,dEgmTCWG_w8.mp4,"It's like the worst roller coaster I've ever been on but To be honest, I mean overall we made it through the sickness."
8043,dEgmTCWG_w8.mp4,We're back to being healthy for the most part.
8044,dEgmTCWG_w8.mp4,I mean like it's it definitely takes a huge toll on you mentally.
8045,dEgmTCWG_w8.mp4,It's messing with my psyche a little bit because I feel like they should have been more prepared for this.
8046,dEgmTCWG_w8.mp4,I really do feel like that.
8047,dEgmTCWG_w8.mp4,It's rough.
8048,dEgmTCWG_w8.mp4,It's been it's getting worse and worse and worse and we're trying to like see the light and it and it's just not it's not there.
8049,dEgmTCWG_w8.mp4,It's taken a toll on our relationship.
8050,dEgmTCWG_w8.mp4,We who are not friends right now.
8051,dEgmTCWG_w8.mp4,So it's really it's hard man.
8052,dEgmTCWG_w8.mp4,It's just hard.
8053,dEgmTCWG_w8.mp4,It's just hard and you can see it from whatever standpoint you want to see it from but the facts are the facts.
8054,dEgmTCWG_w8.mp4,That's where they are.
8055,OcwSWkbuC1I.mp4,"I'm Devon, and I'm going to go get tested for Coronavirus."
8056,OcwSWkbuC1I.mp4,"Hi-yah, thank you."
8057,OcwSWkbuC1I.mp4,Okay.
8058,OcwSWkbuC1I.mp4,All right.
8059,OcwSWkbuC1I.mp4,Thank you.
8060,OcwSWkbuC1I.mp4,Okay.
8061,OcwSWkbuC1I.mp4,"Alright, awesome."
8062,OcwSWkbuC1I.mp4,Thank you.
8063,OcwSWkbuC1I.mp4,"Yeah, but clearly marked."
8064,OcwSWkbuC1I.mp4,"Yeah, walk up server here."
8065,OcwSWkbuC1I.mp4,Very excellent directions.
8066,OcwSWkbuC1I.mp4,I'm gonna carry you just me.
8067,OcwSWkbuC1I.mp4,Do it a good effort.
8068,OcwSWkbuC1I.mp4,Okay.
8069,OcwSWkbuC1I.mp4,All right.
8070,OcwSWkbuC1I.mp4,"Awesome, man."
8071,OcwSWkbuC1I.mp4,Thank you.
8072,OcwSWkbuC1I.mp4,Wasn't that bad?
8073,OcwSWkbuC1I.mp4,"then it Alright, so I just finished getting the coronavirus test and it took about 45 minutes."
8074,OcwSWkbuC1I.mp4,We came in at 3:30.
8075,OcwSWkbuC1I.mp4,So the end of the day because they stopped testing at four and they were quite a few people in line.
8076,OcwSWkbuC1I.mp4,So given that I think it went pretty quick.
8077,OcwSWkbuC1I.mp4,It's not painful.
8078,OcwSWkbuC1I.mp4,It goes really quick and everybody who's thinking about getting tested should it takes no time at all.
8079,Xj1nUFFVK1E.mp4,Coronavirus has are a family of viruses that cause sickness is like the common cold as well as more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome or severe acute respiratory syndrome a novel coronavirus is a new strain one that has not previously been recognized in humans coronavirus has caused diseases in mammals and birds a zoonotic virus is one that is transmitted between animals and people when a virus circulating an animal populations infects people.
8080,Xj1nUFFVK1E.mp4,This is termed a spillover event.
8081,Xj1nUFFVK1E.mp4,Ain't it is speculated that the 2019 novel coronavirus or covid-19 originated in bats and was transmitted to humans possibly with pangolins as an intermediate host.
8082,Xj1nUFFVK1E.mp4,Unfortunately covid-19 is now spreading from Human to human as well covid-19 has surpassed the Stars death toll in a matter of weeks.
8083,Xj1nUFFVK1E.mp4,Even though the death rate is much lower.
8084,Xj1nUFFVK1E.mp4,It spreads faster early data suggests that in around 82% of cases symptoms are relatively mild the illness begins and Ends in the lungs.
8085,Xj1nUFFVK1E.mp4,"However, the remainder of cases are severe or critical typically an older or immunocompromised individuals."
8086,Xj1nUFFVK1E.mp4,How does covid-19 affect the body the virus is fitted with protein spikes sticking out of the envelope that forms the surface and houses a core of genetic material any virus that enters your body looks for cells with compatible receptors ones that allow it to invade the cell.
8087,Xj1nUFFVK1E.mp4,Once they find the right cell they enter and use the cells replication Machinery to create copies of Ourselves it is likely that covid-19 uses the same receptor as SARS found in both lungs and small intestines.
8088,Xj1nUFFVK1E.mp4,It is thought that covid-19 shares many similarities with SARS which has three phases of attack viral replication hyper reactivity of the immune system and finally pulmonary destruction early on an infection the coronavirus invades two types of cells in the lungs mucus and Cilia cells mucus keeps your lungs from drying out and protects them from pathogens.
8089,Xj1nUFFVK1E.mp4,"Sylia, beat the mucus towards the exterior of your body clearing debris including viruses out of your lungs."
8090,Xj1nUFFVK1E.mp4,Sylia cells are the preferred hosts of SARS Covey and are likely the preferred host of the new coronavirus when these cells die.
8091,Xj1nUFFVK1E.mp4,They sloth off into your Airways filling them with debris and fluid symptoms include a fever cough and breathing difficulties many of those infected get pneumonia in both their lungs enter the immune system immune.
8092,Xj1nUFFVK1E.mp4,Has recognized the virus and flood into the lungs the lung tissue becomes inflamed during normal immune function.
8093,Xj1nUFFVK1E.mp4,The inflammatory process is highly regulated and is confined to infected areas.
8094,Xj1nUFFVK1E.mp4,"However, sometimes the immune system overreact and this results in damage to healthy tissue more cells die and Slough off into the lungs further clogging them and worsening the pneumonia as damage to the lungs increases stage 3 begins potentially resulting in respiratory failure."
8095,Xj1nUFFVK1E.mp4,Since that reached the stage of infection can incur permanent lung damage or even die.
8096,Xj1nUFFVK1E.mp4,We see the same lesions in the lungs of those infected by the novel coronavirus as those with SARS SARS creates holes in the lungs.
8097,Xj1nUFFVK1E.mp4,"So they look honey comb like this is probably due to the aforementioned over-reactive immune response which affects both healthy and infected tissue and create scars that stiffen the lungs as such some patients may require ventilators to aid breathing the inflammation also, Schultz in more permeable alveoli alveoli are the location of the thin interface of gas exchange where your lungs replace carbon dioxide in your blood with fresh oxygen you just inhaled increased permeability causes fluid to leak into the lungs this decreases the lungs ability to oxygenate blood and in severe cases floods them so that you become unable to breathe."
8098,Xj1nUFFVK1E.mp4,Sometimes this can be fatal the immune systems over reaction can also cause another kind of damaged proteins called.
8099,Xj1nUFFVK1E.mp4,Cytokines are the immune system's alarm system recruiting immune cells to the infection site over production of cytokines can result in a cytokine storm where there is large-scale inflammation in the body blood vessels become more permeable and fluid seeps out.
8100,Xj1nUFFVK1E.mp4,This makes it difficult for blood and oxygen to reach the rest of the body and can result in multi-organ Failure.
8101,Xj1nUFFVK1E.mp4,This has happened in the most severe cases of covid-19.
8102,Xj1nUFFVK1E.mp4,Although there are no specific treatments for Coronavirus has symptoms can be be treated through supportive care also vaccines are currently in development.
8103,Xj1nUFFVK1E.mp4,"So what can you do to protect yourself from covid-19 advisories vary in different countries, but the basic protocol comes down to regular hand washing avoiding close contact with anyone coughing or sneezing avoiding unnecessary contact with animals washing hands after contact with animals thoroughly cooking meat and eggs prior to consumption and covering your mouth and nose while coughing or sneezing."
8104,Xj1nUFFVK1E.mp4,Respiratory viruses are typically transmitted via droplets in sneezes or coughs of those infected.
8105,Xj1nUFFVK1E.mp4,So preventing their travel stops the spread of disease coming soon.
8106,Xj1nUFFVK1E.mp4,Should you wear a mask?
8107,Xj1nUFFVK1E.mp4,"And if so, what kind Thanks for liking and subscribing."
8108,Xj1nUFFVK1E.mp4,We love getting your comments.
8109,AI2QhstmCdY.mp4,I specialize in crime science future crimes in information Warfare.
8110,AI2QhstmCdY.mp4,So this specific conference is extremely relevant to my work.
8111,AI2QhstmCdY.mp4,I find all of the discussions that we've held in the last couple of weeks to be really eye-opening and very very interesting and I especially like the discussion that we help and about social listening and network analysis has shown that the truly interdisciplinary nature of this conference can work.Marvel's it was just great to have so many experts representing so many fields from all over the world discussing such diverse and interesting phenomenon.
8112,AI2QhstmCdY.mp4,One of the most surprising experiences of the conference was that the online form that we had was quite flawless I much prefer the personal contact but the organizers of the conference that fantastic job and we could have a really really good set of discussions without feeling awkward due to the online form of the whole.
8113,AI2QhstmCdY.mp4,"Event, I will definitely absolutely applied in phrenology approach to my area of research in the study of this information."
8114,AI2QhstmCdY.mp4,And one of the final things that I would like to race is that we should also focus on the role on the role of the nation states in instigating and sponsoring for disinformation campaigns.
8115,AI2QhstmCdY.mp4,Thank you very much.
8116,w1ncGjHExmk.mp4,Is he with you can and then do for turn ha ha.
8117,w1ncGjHExmk.mp4,All right.
8118,w1ncGjHExmk.mp4,I'm a healthy guy.
8119,w1ncGjHExmk.mp4,I'm not a healthcare worker.
8120,w1ncGjHExmk.mp4,"I have no immune compromising condition, but I'm going to take a $99 covid-19 test."
8121,w1ncGjHExmk.mp4,Maybe you're asking how am I able to do this when we've been talking about a lack of testing day in and day out.
8122,w1ncGjHExmk.mp4,We'll get to that in just a minute first.
8123,w1ncGjHExmk.mp4,I'm going to Renton Washington.
8124,w1ncGjHExmk.mp4,I've already signed up online with the website.
8125,w1ncGjHExmk.mp4,It's a partnership between Atlas genomics and anissa's Spine and Pain Care you pay the $99.
8126,w1ncGjHExmk.mp4,You tell them what make and model car you're driving and then you just pull up to the strip mall.
8127,w1ncGjHExmk.mp4,My name is Paul song.
8128,w1ncGjHExmk.mp4,I'm the CEO of the nieces spine and pink are we have the assets to be able to Pivot and do something that was affecting our community quite severely hi there.
8129,w1ncGjHExmk.mp4,How are you?
8130,w1ncGjHExmk.mp4,"Okay, we were just looking at what could we do to be a part of the solution?"
8131,w1ncGjHExmk.mp4,The government has said repeatedly anybody that wants to get tested should be tested.
8132,w1ncGjHExmk.mp4,"No, but the fact on the ground is that's not what's happening like a Band-Aid."
8133,w1ncGjHExmk.mp4,As far as you can.
8134,w1ncGjHExmk.mp4,And then do for turns and then repeat on the other side.
8135,w1ncGjHExmk.mp4,"Okay, it should feel uncomfortable but not painful."
8136,w1ncGjHExmk.mp4,"Okay, okay."
8137,w1ncGjHExmk.mp4,Just make sure that the swab doesn't touch anything on its way out one for both nostrils.
8138,w1ncGjHExmk.mp4,other side other side As you can and then do Fork turn.
8139,w1ncGjHExmk.mp4,"He says go slower, haha."
8140,w1ncGjHExmk.mp4,Okay.
8141,w1ncGjHExmk.mp4,"We've only been open two weeks and we've already tested hundreds of people many of them are just companies who come to us and said hey, can you come and tell us, you know, all of our employees I didn't even know that my nostrils went back that far."
8142,w1ncGjHExmk.mp4,I'm tears streaming down my face.
8143,w1ncGjHExmk.mp4,"Wow, your test results will be available in 24 hours just some information for you."
8144,w1ncGjHExmk.mp4,"If you have any other questions, right?"
8145,w1ncGjHExmk.mp4,Thank you.
8146,w1ncGjHExmk.mp4,I didn't know if I went in for enough if you can believe it.
8147,w1ncGjHExmk.mp4,"I thought I was super deep but I just I was worried that you know, I wasn't deep enough, but she said that because it had a little blood on it."
8148,w1ncGjHExmk.mp4,It was fine.
8149,w1ncGjHExmk.mp4,So I guess that works and I got a sticker all right now to the results and waking up to an email less than 12 hours after I had that test I'm going to find out if I have coronavirus.
8150,w1ncGjHExmk.mp4,"All right, SARS Covey to coronavirus not detected was pretty confident that was going to be the result but actually it's it's really good to know."
8151,w1ncGjHExmk.mp4,It's always good to know important to note that the Department of Health does not recommend testing asymptomatic people right now because someone can be infectious for five days before they start showing any symptoms.
8152,w1ncGjHExmk.mp4,And in that time there could be a high probability of a false negative test.
8153,w1ncGjHExmk.mp4,"When I asked the Department of Health about this $99 test, they said they need more capacity to test high-risk individuals and those with symptoms."
8154,w1ncGjHExmk.mp4,"You can still do that in this drive up test if you needed to but imagine this right now, there are about three hundred and thirty million people in the United."
8155,w1ncGjHExmk.mp4,"Eight if we started testing way early on and spent way less money to test think of how much we could have prevented the two trillion dollars that we're spending as a government to soften the blow when South Korea for example found out what was going on in China, they ramped up testing tenfold private companies started making masks and PPE testing Labs pivoted their business model to test for Coronavirus and look today churches are reopen restaurants are open and they're curved flat and dramatically and very very fast."
8156,w1ncGjHExmk.mp4,Governor Inslee wants to see 20 to 30 thousand tests a day in Washington state to fully modify some of the physical social distancing measures.
8157,w1ncGjHExmk.mp4,We're not even close to that.
8158,w1ncGjHExmk.mp4,"In fact, we're testing at just under six thousand a day."
8159,w1ncGjHExmk.mp4,So the more certified testing we can conduct of the entire population the better off.
8160,w1ncGjHExmk.mp4,We will be stay healthy.
8161,w1ncGjHExmk.mp4,Stay safe and get tested if you can.
8162,4XWbBTwAsUM.mp4,My own state of Indiana just became the first to conduct a Statewide random sample study in the prevalence of covid-19 vection and the results are provided some long-awaited answers to the biggest questions on everyone's mind.
8163,4XWbBTwAsUM.mp4,These are the kind of data.
8164,4XWbBTwAsUM.mp4,We sorely need in order to make safe decisions as we move to reopen and they're the topic of this week's Healthcare triage.
8165,4XWbBTwAsUM.mp4,So far we've had no real idea of the true infection rate of covid-19.
8166,4XWbBTwAsUM.mp4,Despite.
8167,4XWbBTwAsUM.mp4,This states have been moving forward with plans to reopen picking seemingly random dates without any data to back decisions and guide the way with a lack of federal leadership in this realm States will have to start stepping up themselves.
8168,4XWbBTwAsUM.mp4,If they want to make data-informed decisions Indiana's here to set the example.
8169,4XWbBTwAsUM.mp4,They just released the first wave of preliminary data on Statewide covid-19 infection rates providing incredibly useful and somewhat surprising data to guide our state's In a study conducted by the Indiana University Fairbanks School of Public Health and the Indiana State Department of Health 4600.
8170,4XWbBTwAsUM.mp4,Indiana residents were tested between April 25th.
8171,4XWbBTwAsUM.mp4,And May first of these 3600 were randomly selected and over 900 were specifically selected from Minority communities to samples were collected from every participant nasopharyngeal swabs.
8172,4XWbBTwAsUM.mp4,He tests for active infection and a blood sample to test for antibodies which would indicate previous infection in this first wave of result 1.7.
8173,4XWbBTwAsUM.mp4,Percent tested positive for active infection and 1.1% had positive antibodies to the virus bringing the infection prevalence 22.8 percent of all of these 45% were asymptomatic.
8174,4XWbBTwAsUM.mp4,This is lower than many expected.
8175,4XWbBTwAsUM.mp4,That's good because it tells us that the moves we've taken to prevent the spread of the virus of worked infection rates were significantly higher within as opposed to between households suggesting that social distancing measures were effective.
8176,4XWbBTwAsUM.mp4,We lowered infection rates and deaths We avoided overwhelming the healthcare system and that's great.
8177,4XWbBTwAsUM.mp4,But these data bring concerns as well.
8178,4XWbBTwAsUM.mp4,This low number of infections means we're reopening a community with low levels of immunity meaning risk of reinfection is we reopen is high especially given the number of asymptomatic people without symptoms or regular testing.
8179,4XWbBTwAsUM.mp4,They're quite likely to unknowingly spread the virus.
8180,4XWbBTwAsUM.mp4,"These data also tells that we were woefully underreporting infection rates, Indiana was reporting approximately 17,000 cases of covid-19 toward the end of April based on this study, which was designed to allow generalization of the whole state without testing everyone."
8181,4XWbBTwAsUM.mp4,That number is likely closer to a hundred eighty-six thousand.
8182,4XWbBTwAsUM.mp4,That means we were only detecting around one in every 11 cases.
8183,4XWbBTwAsUM.mp4,That means the impact of the virus here in Indiana was about 11 times greater than we suspected based on conventional testing which mostly reaches only symptomatic and high-risk people importantly.
8184,4XWbBTwAsUM.mp4,These numbers have provided the long-missing denominator needed to accurately estimate the infection fatality rate as The case fatality rate.
8185,4XWbBTwAsUM.mp4,It's definitely not great.
8186,4XWbBTwAsUM.mp4,Indiana's number suggest.
8187,4XWbBTwAsUM.mp4,The infection fatality rate is zero point five eight percent since there's been a lot of comparison between the virus and the flu.
8188,4XWbBTwAsUM.mp4,Now's a good time to mention that the average infection fatality rate for seasonal flu is about 0.1 percent approximately six times less deadly.
8189,4XWbBTwAsUM.mp4,So how do we compare with the rest of the country are infection rates higher than our neighbors lower in the west?
8190,4XWbBTwAsUM.mp4,We don't know that's bad news considering that all those places like us are working.
8191,4XWbBTwAsUM.mp4,Going to reopen so bad news aside.
8192,4XWbBTwAsUM.mp4,Thank goodness.
8193,4XWbBTwAsUM.mp4,We have data like these rather than Flying Blind into reopening.
8194,4XWbBTwAsUM.mp4,We're now armed with the knowledge that we might need to keep some social distancing in place that we need to avoid large Gatherings and maintain strict use of other tools like masks virtual work and education spaces and measures and newly reopened businesses to prevent spread its kind of information is sorely needed across the entire country and we're not done in Indiana the second wave of data collection with the new randomly selected group is tentatively scheduled to begin.
8195,4XWbBTwAsUM.mp4,"Next month, these data will allow us to examine how much further the virus is spread in our state and if we need to alter the course of what we're doing to ensure maximum safety during the process of reopening."
8196,4XWbBTwAsUM.mp4,There are many factors involved in a study like this.
8197,4XWbBTwAsUM.mp4,It's complicated and that's all compounded by the fact that we need the data fast.
8198,4XWbBTwAsUM.mp4,Our state's risen to the challenge in no small part because our governor is recognized how critical the situation is and is committed to making data-informed decisions hard to overstate how much the government got involved in National Guard Police emergency.
8199,4XWbBTwAsUM.mp4,Nancy Medical Services not to mention the massive expense of doing this test and they should be commended for that given that the federal response is left much to be desired what happens next in the United States will be largely dependent on seeing that kind of leadership across States page.

8208,U6uluIgw4Yk.mp4,And I've been part of the first who conference on in 50 biology.
8209,U6uluIgw4Yk.mp4,It's been a unique experience to share and listen and be part of a dialogue around for Sprint's relating to the various different approaches and how we're looking at the research and Analysis that's already been completed into the field of disinformation and epidemiology.
8210,U6uluIgw4Yk.mp4,It's clear thatSome practices and methodologies are transferable.
8211,U6uluIgw4Yk.mp4,"It's clear that we can share these methodologies, but it's also clear that we are moving towards looking at ways that we can intervene to protect Global populations from the Infidel mc2."
8212,U6uluIgw4Yk.mp4,Look at how we can intervene and support our science communicators in providing good trusted credible and safe information and what we can do both as organizations and individuals to improve the relationship between good confident good communication and safe information across all the different social media platforms that are presenting us with the challenges that we see today.
8213,AiEFPo_a0F4.mp4,"Portilla After analyzing the signs and symptoms of coronavirus, let us know the emergency warning signs."
8214,AiEFPo_a0F4.mp4,Emergency warning signs for covid-19 is to get medical attention immediately.
8215,AiEFPo_a0F4.mp4,emergency warning signs include one Trouble breathing to persistent pain or pressure in the chest three new confusion or inability to arouse.

8221,AiEFPo_a0F4.mp4,Q and home.
8222,yb1FBExhalk.mp4,SAR scuff to the virus causing covid-19 is a coronavirus many different coronavirus has are known to infect humans.
8223,yb1FBExhalk.mp4,They typically cause respiratory infections of varying degrees of severity in some cases different types of coronavirus is may lead to gastrointestinal infections in the last 20 years.
8224,yb1FBExhalk.mp4,Coronavirus has were the cause of to outbreaks SARS cough in 2002 2003 and MERS cough in.Of in 2019.
8225,yb1FBExhalk.mp4,Another coronavirus are scuffed to emerged in Wuhan China to develop drug treatments and vaccines against are scuffed too.
8226,yb1FBExhalk.mp4,It is essential to understand the structure and characteristics of this novel virus.
8227,yb1FBExhalk.mp4,Let's take a closer look at the structure of source code to the Genome of coronavirus is encoded by a single stranded RNA the RNA surrounded by a lipid envelope which contains a number of Different proteins this gives the coronavirus the appearance of a crown Crown in Latin is Corona hence the name coronavirus.
8228,yb1FBExhalk.mp4,So how does the virus infect human cells?
8229,yb1FBExhalk.mp4,The virus uses a receptor known as a stew in order to gain entry into a host cell Ace 2 receptors are highly expressed in cells of the nose lower respiratory system heart kidney gastrointestinal system and endothelial cells in humans.
8230,yb1FBExhalk.mp4,Proteins present on the surface of the virus known as s protein or Spike proteins bind to the ace to receptor allowing the virus to attach and release its RNA into the cell.
8231,yb1FBExhalk.mp4,"Once the viral genome enters the cell Stars cuff to replicates rapidly, but how does it do this?"
8232,yb1FBExhalk.mp4,The first step in the replication process is for the host ribosome to bind to the viral RNA and through the process of translation produce a protein called RNA dependent RNA polymerase or R Dr. P R Dr. P is an enzyme that can produce new RNA molecules by using an existing viral RNA strand as a template.
8233,yb1FBExhalk.mp4,So once produced the our DRP can create new copies of the viral genome.
8234,yb1FBExhalk.mp4,But the our trp doesn't always replicate the entire viral genome.
8235,yb1FBExhalk.mp4,Sometimes it stops early and creates shorter RNA strands which are known as sub genomic rnas the host ribosomes translate these pieces of subject.
8236,yb1FBExhalk.mp4,Ohmic rnas into proteins.
8237,yb1FBExhalk.mp4,Specific enzymes known as Proteus has then come along and cut the proteins into individual structural proteins.
8238,yb1FBExhalk.mp4,Then the replicated viral RNA and proteins can be packaged up into a new virus which is released from the cell and ready to infect another cell or another person based on what we know about star scuff to and other similar viruses such as SARS kv-- researchers have identified several potential treatment targets.
8239,yb1FBExhalk.mp4,We've seen how important RNA replication and protein synthesis are for viral replication.
8240,yb1FBExhalk.mp4,So it's not surprising that many potential treatments Target these processes REM the severe a broad-spectrum antiviral drug inhibits the RNA dependent RNA polymerase and may block viral genome replication.
8241,yb1FBExhalk.mp4,Loopy nevere a drug used in combination with ritonavir to treat HIV binds to specific source code of to proteases.
8242,yb1FBExhalk.mp4,Preventing the proper translation of viral proteins blocking this pathway May disrupt the survival of the virus.
8243,yb1FBExhalk.mp4,"Of course, there are many other possible targets for Therapeutics blocking the interaction between the spike proteins and the ace to receptor wouldn't kill the virus, but it would prevent it from infecting a cell and without a host the virus couldn't replicate which would severely limit its ability to infect although we still have a lot to learn about SARS cough to understanding."
8244,yb1FBExhalk.mp4,It's Structure and how it infects host cells is the first step to identifying potential treatment targets against are scuffed too.
8245,yb1FBExhalk.mp4,That's it for now.
8246,yb1FBExhalk.mp4,"If you want to improve your understanding of covid-19, make sure to register for a free Matt Mastery trial account and check out our CME accredited courses."
8247,yb1FBExhalk.mp4,So stay safe and see you next time.
8248,9TDDvTYNRfM.mp4,A novel drug developed in st. Louis for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis is being explored as a possible treatment for covid-19.
8249,9TDDvTYNRfM.mp4,So the name of the drug is a TI 450.
8250,9TDDvTYNRfM.mp4,"We started this project back in 2010 as one of the projects when we first initiated Confluence, Joe Monahan is the Executive Vice President of research and development for a Clara's Therapeutics."
8251,9TDDvTYNRfM.mp4,He oversees the research and development arm called confluence.
8252,9TDDvTYNRfM.mp4,Discovery Technologies having partnered with bio STL Confluence operates out of the Bayou generator lab space.
8253,9TDDvTYNRfM.mp4,It's in the cortex bioscience District of st. Louis known as one of the fastest-growing biotech districts in the country.
8254,9TDDvTYNRfM.mp4,"We get a lot of preclinical work in cells and animals to make sure the drug did work particularly as an anti-inflammatory drug first put it into people normal Volunteers in 2019 to is to test the safety in 20 a Clara's is part of a larger clinical trial for people with rheumatoid arthritis, but now another clinical trial is underway to treat patients with a novel coronavirus."
8255,9TDDvTYNRfM.mp4,That's because covid-19 can cause acute respiratory distress syndrome AR DS.
8256,9TDDvTYNRfM.mp4,"What is it that made you say this drug needs to be investigated literature that's come out over the past, you know, four or five months suggest that one of the causes of this Ard the syndrome is a hyperactive immune response."
8257,9TDDvTYNRfM.mp4,"So the immune system is triggered when you get the viral infection, but for some reason the immune system goes a little haywire and this results in a inflammatory State the data suggests that this inflammatory state in this hyper inflammation is associated with an upregulation of certain proteins that come from both diseased tissue and immune cells called cytokines, and these cytokines could be the Fruit in driving this AR DS and the inflammation seen in the long and covid patients."
8258,9TDDvTYNRfM.mp4,And so what a TI 450 does and the reason it really think it could work in rheumatoid arthritis.
8259,9TDDvTYNRfM.mp4,Is it down regulates the cytokines so inhibits the production of these cytokines and many of the same cytokines that are involved in the inflammation in an arthritic joint are also involved in the inflammation in the lung of a covid patient the hope is that eight.
8260,9TDDvTYNRfM.mp4,ATI 450 a drug that doesn't have a name just yet will help we had that preclinical data that suggested that we could block a number of these cytokines and in blocking these cytokines.
8261,9TDDvTYNRfM.mp4,The hypothesis would be that we would stop to progression of the infection.
8262,9TDDvTYNRfM.mp4,"We would stop the hyper inflammation, and we would stop progression to a RDS in these patients."
8263,9TDDvTYNRfM.mp4,"ATI 450 is now being used in a clinical trial for hospitalized covid-19 patients at the University of Kansas Medical Center in Kansas City, Kansas."
8264,9TDDvTYNRfM.mp4,Is it would be a patient who is moving toward the ICU but has not gotten there yet.
8265,9TDDvTYNRfM.mp4,The placebo-controlled study will involve 36 patients.
8266,9TDDvTYNRfM.mp4,This can lead to a large-scale clinical trial and rolling hundreds of patients.
8267,9TDDvTYNRfM.mp4,"We want to get the study completed as quickly as possible get the data so that if it's positive we can move on to a larger study to impact more people as far as the drugs name is concerned ATI stands for a Claire's Therapeutics Incorporated and the number is So your drug is known by a number, but at what point will you have a name?"
8268,9TDDvTYNRfM.mp4,We're in the process of working with a company that helps name drugs to come up with the generic name for this this compound.
8269,9TDDvTYNRfM.mp4,And so we're in the midst of going through naming right now.
8270,bTgrDXgVdzQ.mp4,In the last few weeks.
8271,bTgrDXgVdzQ.mp4,I have been working almost Around the Clock.
8272,bTgrDXgVdzQ.mp4,I'm an obstetrician.
8273,bTgrDXgVdzQ.mp4,So I'm used to sleeping at odd hours and going a long time without sleep.
8274,bTgrDXgVdzQ.mp4,And so when there's a new epidemic or pandemic like there is with covid-19.
8275,bTgrDXgVdzQ.mp4,I rely on that and it's been a really crazy time for all of us right now.
8276,bTgrDXgVdzQ.mp4,We've heard that pregnant women may not be affected.
8277,bTgrDXgVdzQ.mp4,But that's based on very very very few numbers.
8278,bTgrDXgVdzQ.mp4,We don't know if there is a higher risk.
8279,bTgrDXgVdzQ.mp4,For preterm birth or stillbirth or what happens to children that were exposed to the virus in utero and what happens then when they grow up I'd like to research these things so we can better understand how to protect pregnant women and their children.
8280,bTgrDXgVdzQ.mp4,My lab will be analyzing the early immune responses and the late immune responses in pregnant women who have become infected with the virus that causes covid-19.
8281,bTgrDXgVdzQ.mp4,"19 we're interested in understanding what is different about the infection and pregnant women how this infection can impact growth of the fetus placental biology and whether it can cause an increased risk for problems in pregnancy, like preterm birth and stillbirth."
8282,bTgrDXgVdzQ.mp4,I think that patients should be asking their doctors how they can enroll in telemedicine programs.
8283,bTgrDXgVdzQ.mp4,The University of Washington is Unique in that we have had an established.
8284,bTgrDXgVdzQ.mp4,Tell OB health program for a while with an infrastructure.
8285,bTgrDXgVdzQ.mp4,We are rapidly enrolling all of our physicians into this program so that we can better serve our patients.
